Background to the Financial 
Stability Review
The primary mandate of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), as stated in the 
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, is to achieve and maintain price stability 
in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth in South Africa. The 
Financial Sector Regulation Act 9 of 2017 (FSR Act) assigns a statutory mandate to 
the SARB to protect and enhance financial stability in South Africa. 
The SARB follows a structured framework designed to gather information and monitor 
developments, assess financial stability, and communicate its assessment through 
the Financial Stability Review (FSR) . Among other things, the FSR Act requires the 
SARB to (i) monitor and review any risks to financial stability, including the nature 
and extent of those risks as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the financial 
system; and (ii) take steps to mitigate risks to financial stability, including advising the 
financial sector regulators and any other organ of state of the steps to take in order 
to mitigate those risks. 
The FSR Act also requires the SARB to assess the stability of the South African 
financial system at least every six months and to communicate its assessment in the 
FSR. The FSR  provides readers with the SARB’s assessment of the stability of the 
South African financial system. The SARB assesses financial stability as part of its 
ongoing operations and its Financial Stability Committee (FSC) reviews the financial 
stability outlook and assessment at four meetings per year. The period under review 
for this edition of the FSR  is the six months from June to November 2024, while the 
forecast period is until November 2025.
The FSR is tabled in Parliament and is targeted at the Members of Parliament, 
participants in the financial sector, international central bank peers, ratings agencies, 
international financial institutions, standard-setting bodies and academia. The 
FSR aims to stimulate debate on pertinent issues related to financial stability in 
South Africa.

Executive summary
The South African financial system has demonstrated notable resilience over the past 
several years, despite various global and idiosyncratic shocks. Following the start of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, several other global shocks materialised, such as 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, disruptions to supply chains and transportation routes, 
sharp increases in inflation and interest rates and, more recently, escalating conflicts 
in the Middle East. 
Domestic developments have further tested the resilience of the South African 
financial system in recent years. These include South Africa’s sovereign credit rating 
downgrade, the subsequent exclusion from the World Government Bond Index 
(WGBI), greylisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), unprecedented levels 
of load-shedding, extreme weather events such as floods, and violent incidents of 
social unrest. 
Since the release of the June 2024 FSR , however, the outlook for financial stability 
has improved. This is largely attributable to an orderly election and the formation of 
the Government of National Unity (GNU), which contributed notably to stabilising 
the political landscape. Other factors, such as an improvement in the availability and 
supply of electricity, evidence of fiscal consolidation and an improved sovereign credit 
rating outlook, also supported positive investor sentiment towards South Africa. 
Despite the improved financial stability outlook, a number of key risks to domestic 
financial stability remain. These include the risk of:
1. escalating global conflicts; 
2. deteriorating public sector debt ratios; 
3. rapid capital outflows amid declining financial market depth; 
4.  increased financial distress in households and small, medium and micro enterprises 
(SMMEs); 
5. critical infrastructure failure; and 
6. remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term. 
These risks are assessed against the backdrop of perpetual or structural risks, such 
as South Africa’s low and inequitable economic growth, the implications of climate 
change for the financial sector and the ever-present vulnerabilities associated with 
cyber incidents with systemic impact.
This edition of the FSR  also includes a summary of the impact studies the SARB 
conducted on the potential economic impact of implementing a 1% positive cycle-
neutral (PCN) countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The results confirm that the 
introduction of a 1% PCN CCyB would have a marginal and temporary impact on

lending supply and broader macroeconomic activity, and underscore the longer-
term financial stability benefits of such a countercyclical policy tool.
The changing composition of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in South Africa and 
an assessment of vulnerabilities in the South African commercial real estate sector 
are also topical focus areas covered in this edition of the FSR.

developments and outlook
Global developments and risks
Since the release of the June 2024 FSR, selected measures of volatility have increased 
(Figure 1). The elevated level of global uncertainty has seen gold – the historical safe-
haven asset – benefit significantly. The gold price increased from around US$2 000 
per ounce at the start of 2024 to almost US$2 7 00 per ounce at the end of October 
2024 – an increase of 35%. However, volatility reduced following the conclusion of the 
United States (US) elections as uncertainty over the outcome ended.

Recent episodes of heightened volatility, such as the one observed in early August 
2024,1  demonstrated that markets have become increasingly sensitive to economic 
news, especially where valuations are high. In addition, markets across jurisdictions 
have become increasingly correlated when reacting to negative news as demonstrated 
by the August 2024 market turbulence.
Financial conditions in selected advanced economies have eased somewhat since 
the release of the previous edition of the FSR (Figure 2), largely supported by policy 
rate cuts and expectations of further cuts in 2025 (Figure 3). 
1  Disappointing US labour market data released on 2 August 2024 reignited investor concerns over a 
US recession. Japanese markets subsequently bore the brunt of the fallout, with the Tokyo Stock Price 
Index declining by 12% on 5 August 2024. For a more detailed discussion, see the Bank for International 
Settlements’ note on the topic: https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull90.htm.

One of the key global financial stability risks highlighted by the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) in its latest Global Financial Stability Report is rapidly rising sovereign 
debt levels. 2 The IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor predicts that global public debt will 
exceed US$100 trillion – or 94% of global gross domestic product (GDP) – in 2024 
and increase to around 100% of GDP by 2030. 3 The IMF anticipates that public debt 
will either stabilise or decline in approximately two-thirds of countries. Concerningly, 
countries where debt is not projected to stabilise account for around two-thirds of 
global GDP and more than half of global debt.

Other developments that weigh on the global financial stability outlook include 
escalating geopolitical tensions and conflicts, high levels of private debt and concerns 
about the ability of households and businesses to service their debt. Fragilities in 
commercial real estate markets remain, while the economic slowdown in China 
continues to be closely monitored after the announcement of several government 
stimulus measures.
Domestic developments 
In addition to the above-mentioned global risks and vulnerabilities, South Africa 
has faced various idiosyncratic domestic risks and challenges in recent years. These 
include the country’s sovereign credit rating downgrade to sub-investment grade, the 
resultant exclusion from the WGBI, greylisting by the FATF, unprecedented levels of 
load-shedding, natural disasters such as floods and violent incidents of social unrest. 
Since the release of the June 2024 FSR, which broadly coincided with South Africa’s 
general elections and the formation of the coalition government, investor sentiment 
towards South Africa has improved. This was supported by other factors such as 
improved availability and supply of electricity, an improved  sovereign credit rating 
outlook and demonstrable efforts in pursuit of fiscal consolidation. 
Government debt increased marginally from 74.1% of GDP in the first quarter of 2024 
to 74.6% of GDP in the second quarter. The Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency 
Reserve Account (GFECRA) distribution should reduce government’s funding needs 
and support fiscal consolidation in the near term. Against this backdrop, South 
Africa’s country risk – as measured by the sovereign bond spread – improved to 
its lowest level of 2024, some 69 basis points lower than its peers as at the end of 
September (Figure 4).

Since the beginning of 2024, several emerging market (EM) currencies have 
depreciated against the US dollar (Figure 7). However, the rand strengthened 
by almost 6% against the US dollar i n the year to October 2024 as investor 
sentiment towards South Africa improved. Despite weakening in the aftermath of 
the US elections, the rand has still strengthened by 4.3% against the US dollar in the 
year to date.

The SARB compiles a financial conditions index (FCI), which gives an overall view of 
the ease with which firms, households and government can access finance. The FCI – 
summarised in Box 1 – shows that domestic financial conditions remain relatively tight 
(Figure 8). Volatility in the equity market subsided somewhat at the start of 2024 but 
resumed in the build-up to South Africa’s 29 May general elections and has remained 
high since. Other factors that contributed to tight financial conditions are a decline 
in household credit, elevated long-term government bond yields and high exchange 
rate volatility. Real property prices have continued to fall, declining by 4.4% year on 
year in the second quarter of 2024. However, since South Africa’s elections, financial 
conditions have shown signs of easing, in part due to higher equity prices and an 
uptick in investor sentiment. Real disposable income growth, debt-service costs and 
the debt-to-disposable-income ratio for the household sector improved marginally 
in the second quarter of 2024.

Box 1: The SARB FCI for South Africa1
1  The revised SARB FCI is supported by a research paper on the underlying methodology, which is 
available at https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home/what-we-do/financial-stability .
2 A positive sign reflects a tightening of financial conditions and vice versa.
Financial conditions can be broadly defined as the ease with which firms, households and 
government can access finance. When financial conditions are tighter, it is more difficult 
to access finance, while looser financial conditions mean easier access to finance. The 
main purpose of the SARB FCI is to assess and summarise prevailing financial conditions 
within the domestic financial system. 
There are several methods to construct FCIs, but the process entails identifying the 
objectives to be achieved through the FCI, selecting the variables required and calculating 
the weights associated with the variables to form the index. The SARB previously utilised 
a more complex method to construct the FCI, comprising more than 30 variables with 
time-varying weights assigned to them. This made it more challenging to communicate 
the drivers behind changes in financial conditions, as well as changes in the FCI, which 
sometimes appeared counterintuitive. The revised SARB FCI reflects a simpler and more 
intuitive FCI.
FCIs typically use variables that provide insights into interest rates, asset prices, credit 
extension and external conditions. The SARB FCI employs the nine key variables listed 
in Table B1.1, all of which are available at a monthly frequency from the year 2000. Each 
variable contributes equally to the FCI, thereby ensuring a balanced representation across 
different financial indicators. Despite the uniform weighting, specific signs 2 are assigned 
to the variables as they enter the system as shown in Table B1.1. 
Table B1.1: Variables and signs for the SARB FCI
Variable Sign

Sovereign credit default swap spread +

Equity prices, month-on-month (m-o-m) growth rate -
Real household price index, m-o-m growth rate -

This approach provides a simplified, yet effective, means of interpreting shifts in financial 
conditions, where every variable holds equivalent influence in the overall assessment.

Key financial stability risks and assessment 
In this edition of the FSR , the following key risks to domestic financial stability are 
included in the SARB’s Residual Vulnerability Matrix (RVM): 4
1. escalating global conflicts;
2. deteriorating public sector debt ratios;
3. rapid capital outflows amid declining financial market depth;
4. increased financial distress in households and SMMEs;
5. critical infrastructure failure; and
6. remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term.
The perpetual risks to financial stability include (i) persistently low and inequitable 
domestic economic growth; (ii) the impact of climate change on the financial sector; 
and (iii) the ever-present threat of a cyber incident with systemic impact. These 
risks are reflected on the SARB’s RVM, which reflects the SARB’s assessment of the 
residual vulnerability of the South African financial system to the identified risks. The 
closer to the outer edge of the circle, the higher the residual vulnerability and vice 
versa. Each of these key risks is discussed below.

Escalating global conflicts
As a small, open economy, South Africa remains vulnerable to the broader 
effects of geopolitical shocks. Escalating conflicts, such as those in the Middle 
East and between Russia and Ukraine, and the geopolitical tensions that build up 
between economic blocs, threaten financial stability through two main channels. 
4  This edition of the FSR  introduces a revised RVM that shows the residual vulnerability of the financial 
system to key financial stability risks. Residual vulnerability takes into account both the probability 
of a risk materialising within the forecast period (i.e. the next 12 months), and the effect of mitigating 
(or amplifying) factors that reduce (or increase) the financial system’s vulnerability to these risks. 
The revised RVM aligns the SARB’s financial stability monitoring and assessment framework with the 
approach of the Financial Stability Board, which focuses on the vulnerabilities and resilience of the 
global financial system, after considering mitigating factors and actions.

First, they contribute to heightened financial market volatility and uncertainty, which 
commonly shift investor sentiment away from riskier financial assets and lead to a 
flight to safe-haven assets. This generally means that EMs in particular could see 
large capital outflows and currency depreciation triggered by unexpected exogenous 
factors over which they have little or no control. 
Second, the conflict in the Middle East has disrupted shipping supply channels, 
delaying the transportation of goods as alternative routes have had to be used at 
higher costs. Combined with associated higher oil and commodity prices, these costs 
could reignite upward inflationary pressures, which could slow – or even reverse – the 
decline in global interest rates. As a net importer of oil, and coupled with possible 
currency depreciation in EMs that would likely accompany rising global conflicts, 
South Africa could experience sharp increases in transportation and production costs. 
This, in turn, could contribute to higher inflation, which would require an appropriate 
monetary policy response. 
The IMF has warned that escalating global conflicts are eroding the benefits of 
the global integration that occurred in recent decades. 5 The surge in the number 
of trade restrictions that were introduced after the global financial crisis (GFC), the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia−Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East have 
exacerbated divisions between trading blocs. From a financial stability perspective, 
growing preferences for ‘friendshoring’ or ‘nearshoring’ may reduce access to a more 
diverse range of markets, in turn potentially also increasing the cost and availability 
of funding, hedging and diversification options. This could contribute to financial 
markets globally becoming shallower and less liquid, which could amplify the impact 
of a shock.
An increase in geopolitical conflicts generally leads to a higher number of cyberattacks 
globally, particularly against the countries involved. 6 Such attacks may extend to 
countries not directly involved in conflicts, but which may be seen as being aligned 
with or sympathetic to a particular country or group involved in a conflict.
Deteriorating public sector debt ratios
Since the release of the June 2024 FSR , the fiscal outlook has improved somewhat. 
An improved domestic growth outlook, combined with the transfer of GFECRA 
balances of R100 billion from the SARB to National Treasury in the current fiscal year, 
has reduced government’s funding needs and supported an improved fiscal outlook. 
After persistently recording primary deficits between 2009 and 2023, South Africa 
recorded its first primary surplus in the 2023/24 fiscal year. Primary surpluses are 
also expected for the next three fiscal years.
A general improvement in market sentiment toward South African sovereign debt after 
the formation of the GNU helped to suppress borrowing costs. The implementation 
of the two-pot retirement system in September 2024 should also support fiscal 
revenues. Government debt as a share of GDP is projected to peak at 75.5% in the 
2026/27 fiscal year, marginally higher and a year later than the projected peak of 
75.3% in the 2025/26 fiscal year announced in the 2024 Budget Review (Figure 10). 
Debt-service costs are also expected to stabilise at a modestly higher level than 
previously projected (Figure 11).

Several risks, however, remain to the fiscal outlook. De spite the GFECRA transfers 
and the boost to fiscal revenue from the introduction of the two-pot pension system, 
the fiscal position remains vulnerable to shocks. Consistent with recent years, the 
2024 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) included an upward revision to 
the main budget deficit over the forecast horizon due to revenue underperformance, 
increased expenditure and higher debt-service costs. Debt-service costs increased 
relative to the 2024 Budget Review  projections, despite the notable decrease 
in sovereign borrowing costs this year. These developments suggest that debt 
sustainability will remain a challenge going forward. 7

The increase in non-interest expenditure may be attributed to above-inflation increases 
in public sector wages, disaster relief and expenditure on state-owned enterprise 
(SOE) obligations. All three of these factors are likely to constrain the fiscal outlook 
over the medium term. Indeed, several SOEs have in recent years required bail-outs, 
or had been supported by explicit or implicit government guarantees for their debt. 
Moreover, there are increasing demands on the fiscus to address the deteriorating 
critical infrastructure in South Africa, exacerbated by the weak financial positions of 
large SOEs such as Transnet and Eskom. 
The South African financial system’s exposure to government debt has increased 
further since the release of the June 2024 FSR, as government bond issuance has 
remained elevated relative to its historical average. 8 SAGBs continued to dominate 
the local bond market, peaking at almost 94% of all listed bonds at the end of 
March 2024 in the build-up to the general elections before moderating to 89.7% at 
the end of July (Figure 12).

There has been a modest increase in non-resident investor demand for SAGBs since 
the release of the June 2024 FSR . However, because of sustained SAGB issuance, 
non-resident investors’ share of SAGB holdings has not increased and the domestic 
financial sector continued to absorb most of the new bond issuance (Figure 13). 
Faced with limited investment opportunities amid weak economic growth and a 
shrinking equity market due to net JSE Limited (JSE) delistings in recent years, the 
asset management industry has absorbed the largest proportion of new government 
debt issuance since 2020. The exposure of banks to government debt decreased to 
20% at the end of August 2024, down from 20.7% in April. 
South Africa’s structural challenge of low economic growth, high unemployment 
and high interest rates have reduced the overall creditworthiness of borrowers and 
made banks more sensitive to credit risk. The reduced creditworthiness of borrowers 
has constrained private sector credit extension by banks, incentivising banks to 
rather invest in government debt with high yields. Although this trend seems to have 
been arrested, banks’ holdings of SAGBs remains well above pre-pandemic levels 
(Figure 13).
8  The growing collective exposure of the South African financial system to a single issuer (i.e. the 
government) is referred to as the sovereign-financial sector nexus. The associated financial stability 
implications have been covered extensively in recent editions of the FSR .

Banks’ investment in government debt is further driven by the zero-risk weighting 
applied to bonds under the standardised approach to credit risk, which is mostly 
followed by non-systemic banks. A low- or zero-risk weighting means that banks 
hold little or no regulatory capital against these assets, which may have contributed 
to the decline in banks’ risk-weighted assets over the past few years (Figure 14).

As government borrowing is projected to remain elevated, the risk of further increases 
in the financial sector’s exposure to the sovereign is high. However, there are also 
potential mitigating factors that could help to shift domestic savings to the private 
sector rather than to government. Should the recent improvement in foreign investor 
sentiment towards South Africa prevail, the reliance on the domestic financial system 
to fund the fiscal deficit may reduce. Also, a reduction in credit risk as interest 
rates decline and the growth outlook improves may incentivise banks to increase 
credit extension to the private sector instead of buying government bonds. The 
improvement in the growth outlook may also result in more investment opportunities 
for non-banks. 
Increased financial distress in households and SMMEs
During the lockdown imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, households’ 
gross savings as a share of GDP increased significantly. At the same time, regulatory 
relief provided by the Prudential Authority (PA) to the banking sector at the onset 
of COVID-19 in 2020 allowed banks to restructure a significant amount of loans. 9 
As COVID-19-related restrictions eased and the economy started to open up, 
corporates and households had some savings to fall back on to help finance their 
consumption. These savings buffers also shielded them from the initial effects of 
rising interest rates. 
As borrowers’ ability to repay credit improved, the regulatory relief was withdrawn 
in October 2021. 10 While the current volume of restructured loans does not pose an 
immediate threat to financial stability, an increasing dependence on restructuring  
could conceal underlying credit weaknesses and introduce systemic risks if not 
managed properly.
Following the onset of interest rate increases in November 2021, borrowers started 
showing signs of financial stress towards mid-2022, with an increasing proportion of 
borrowers encountering difficulties in meeting their loan obligations. Non-performing 
loans (NPLs),11 an indicator of credit risk, are recognised as one of the primary factors 
that historically contributed to bank failures and subsequent banking crises. From 
March 2023 to July 2024, NPLs rose significantly from R257 billion to R304 billion, 
with the NPL ratio12 increasing from 4.7% to 5.7% (Figure 15).
9  To manage risk effectively, many banks employ loan restructuring strategies to aid borrowers in 
managing their debt. This approach not only reduces default rates but also enhances the financial 
stability of the institution. Loan restructuring presents a cost-effective credit risk mitigation strategy 
compared to, for example, repossession. While repossession involves substantial expenses, including 
legal fees and potential asset depreciation, restructuring primarily requires administrative adjustments 
at a lower cost. Banks can support their borrowers while safeguarding their investments and avoiding 
the significant costs and losses associated with repossession through restructuring. Refer to Banks Act 
Directive 3 of 2020 for more information.
10 Refer to Banks Act Directive 7 of 2021.
11  NPLs are proxied by impaired advances or accounts overdue by more than 90 days (i.e. loans or 
advances that have been identified as impaired), with objective evidence that these borrowers are 
experiencing significant financial difficulty that will likely result in a loss incurred by the bank.
12 The NPL ratio is the ratio of impaired advances to loans and advances.

In response to rising NPLs, banks have increased their general and specific provisions 
against doubtful exposures since February 2023. These provisions peaked in April 
and June 2024 respectively (Figure 21). The overall coverage ratio has also increased 
since the start of 2024, which suggests that banks are increasingly capable of covering 
outstanding exposure amounts, thereby enhancing the sector’s resilience in the face 
of potential economic headwinds. 13 An improvement in the ratio signifies a proactive

Although the overall coverage ratio shows improvement, there are signs of 
financial distress in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) corporate sector 
(Figure 22). The growth in NPLs in the SME corporate sector has outpaced the rise in 
overall NPLs since mid-2022, leading to a decline in banks’ SME corporate coverage 
ratio to around, and occasionally below, its long-term average. Small businesses 
generally have less room than large corporates to protect themselves against shocks 
such as the COVID-19 lockdowns and high degrees of load-shedding, or against the 
effects of rising interest rates. 
The continued increase in provisions against SME corporate loans and the relatively 
small proportion of SME loans in banks’ total loan portfolios (5.7% at the end of July 
2024), provide comfort about the resilience of the aggregate banking sector against 
credit risk in SME corporate loan portfolios. However, individual banks may be more 
exposed, requiring close monitoring of the declining coverage ratio and possibly a 
re-evaluation of risk management strategies within the sector.

Rapid capital outflows amid declining financial 
market depth14 
From a financial stability perspective, the more liquid, deeper and diversified 
financial markets are, the larger the shock that they can absorb without becoming 
dysfunctional. In financial markets that are shallower and less liquid, smaller 
shocks may be amplified and have a disproportionate disruptive effect. The 
June 2024 edition of the FSR  noted a significant decline in market depth and 
liquidity, which was caused by capital outflows, the dominance of government bonds 
in the domestic debt market and the buy-and-hold strategies favoured by investors, 
among other factors. 
The financial system’s vulnerability to the risk of declining market depth has reduced 
somewhat since the release of the June 2024 FSR . The post-election optimism 
towards the current political environment, coupled with a stronger rand-US dollar 
exchange rate, has supported demand for domestic assets, especially SAGBs. By 
contrast, equity flows continued to decline despite the positive sentiment, with 
foreign investors looking for more sustained economic reforms. Non-residents were 
net sellers of JSE-listed shares worth R 113.3 billion and net buyers of R2 5.3 billion in 
bonds in the year to mid-November 2024 (Figure 23).
14  Market depth in this context refers to the combination of market depth (i.e. high market capitalisation), 
market liquidity (i.e. material amounts can be traded without a disproportionate impact on price) and 
market diversification (i.e. there is a wide variety of borrowers and lenders active in the market).

Non-resident holdings of SAGBs increased marginally to 25% at the end of 
October 2024, up from 24.6% in April (Figure 24). While non-residents have been 
net buyers of government bonds this year, their demand has lagged the pace of 
new debt issuance. The structural decline in foreign participation in the government 
bond market is consistent with South Africa’s steadily declining share in major EM 
bond indices, such as the JPMorgan Government Bond Index for Emerging Markets, 
following the introduction of other countries such as India. South Africa has also been 
excluded from other major indices, including the WGBI in 2017. 15

The collective exposure of the South African financial system to a single issuer 
(i.e. the government) has contributed to a decline in government bond market 
liquidity in recent years. Liquidity and depth in domestic bond and equity markets, 
measured as bond and equity turnover as a percentage of total market capitalisation, 
have been declining broadly in parallel. 16  
Bid-ask spreads in the SAGB market have widened and become more volatile 
(Figure 25). The notable spikes in the bid-ask spread have coincided with several 
unexpected global and domestic events over the past few decades, including the 
Asian crisis (1997), the Taper Tantrum (2013), South Africa’s downgrade by credit 
rating agencies (2017) and COVID-19 (2020). High and volatile spreads are one of the 
symptoms of low market depth and liquidity.

Although there has been a decline in foreign participation in domestic bond and 
equity markets over the past five years, the trend is not unique to South Africa. With 
the exception of Peru and the Czech Republic, all EMs have a lower non-resident 
participation rate compared to a decade ago. In particular, EMs that experienced 
large bond market inflows in the aftermath of the 2008 GFC have experienced 
similar declines in foreign participation in recent years. The drivers of this decline are 
standard capital market and real economy features, such as the increase in advanced 
economy yields following the recent interest rate hiking cycle and low real growth 
rates. Declining participation by non-residents contributes to lower market depth 
and liquidity. However, lower holdings by non-residents mitigate the impact of rapid 
capital outflows as the bulk of assets are held by local investors.
Critical infrastructure failure
The deterioration in critical national infrastructure such as roads, railways, water 
and electricity has contributed to South Africa’s structural challenge of low 
and inequitable economic growth. As covered in detail in recent editions of 
the FSR, South Africa experienced record levels of load-shedding in 2023, with 
almost 25 000 gigawatt hours (GWh) shed over a total of 287 days (Figure 26). This 
has improved significantly in 2024 ; in the first 10  months of the year South Africa

experienced 69 days of load-shedding, with just over 4 100 GWh shed. One of the 
main reasons for the improvement is the higher electricity availability factor (EAF), 
which rose from just over 51% in January 2024 to over 6 3.6% in November  2024 
(Figure 27). A key contributing factor to the increase in the EAF is a reduction in the 
demand for Eskom-supplied electricity as alternative energy sources increase.

The sustained deterioration in critical infrastructure poses direct operational risks 
that could disrupt the functioning of the financial system. While electricity availability 
appears to be gradually returning to historical trends, other critical infrastructure 
such as the supply and quality of water as well as transport infrastructure – especially 
rail, port and road networks – continues to degrade. 
November 2024FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW
23
There are also indirect, non-operational transmission channels through which 
deteriorating infrastructure could affect financial stability. First, numerous 
municipalities are in a precarious financial position. For some municipalities, the 
bulk of their revenue is generated by on-selling critical services such as electricity 
and water. The failure of critical infrastructure could therefore threaten the financial 
viability of various municipalities, in turn affecting their ability to service their debt 
in the financial sector, and potentially placing further strain on the fiscus should 
government support be provided. 
Second, deteriorating critical national infrastructure negatively affects municipalities’ 
ability to deliver key services. To help compensate for these declining revenue 
streams, many municipalities have implemented above-inflation increases in their 
rates and taxes. This adds to general social discontent, which could make societies 
more prone to events such as the June 2021 riots, with subsequent losses having to 
be absorbed by the financial system. 
Third, high municipal rates and taxes increase the hurdle rates at which new commercial 
property developments become viable and can threaten the sustainability of existing 
commercial property. This contributes to a cycle of low investment in new commercial 
developments, low maintenance and financial defaults in certain areas.
To increase the operational resilience of the domestic financial system against the failure 
of critical national infrastructure, in 2023 the SARB, together with the Financial Sector 
Contingency Forum (FSCF), announced the development of various contingency 
plans. The initiative was initially motivated by the risk of an electricity grid collapse and 
the first phases of the project focused predominantly on how financial markets would 
be closed and reopened in an orderly manner. 17 In 2024, the focus was broadened 
to increase the operational resilience of the financial sector more generally to ensure 
business continuity under different disruption scenarios. A current priority initiative is 
to establish direct connectivity among key nodes in the financial sector in a scenario 
where existing telecommunication networks are unable to function so that a certain 
level of payment, clearing and settlement activity can continue.
Financial institutions acknowledge the importance of business continuity and the 
need to strengthen the sector’s operational resilience as a collective. There are 
certain extreme – possibly systemic – events that could threaten the interoperable 
and interconnected financial sector value chain, impairing the continuation of core 
processes across the ecosystem. As such, appropriate measures need to be put in 
place to limit the ultimate impact of such events and ease the resumption process 
once possible. 
Remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term18 
As noted in recent editions of the FSR , remaining on the FATF greylist beyond June 
2025 – the first opportunity for South Africa to be removed from the list – exposes 
the financial system to various vulnerabilities. On 25 October 2024, the FATF Plenary 
announced upgrades to nine action items on South Africa’s 22-item Action Plan, 
including eight to ‘largely addressed’ and one to ‘partly addressed’ . As stated in 
National Treasury’s media statement on the same date, South Africa is now deemed 
to have largely or fully addressed 16 of the 22 action items in its Action Plan, leaving 
the country with six outstanding action items to be addressed in the last scheduled 
reporting cycle concluding in February 2025. 19
17 See ‘SARB statement on the role of the Financial Sector Contingency Forum’, 21 February 2023.
18  This risk has been rephrased from ‘Remaining on the FATF greylist beyond June 2025’ to ‘Remaining 
on the FATF greylist over the medium term’ to reflect that vulnerabilities associated with being on the 
greylist will increase the longer South Africa remains on it.
19  See ‘FATF greylisting: South Africa’s positive progress as at October 2024’, 25 October 2024. https://
www.gov.za/news/media-statements/national-treasury-fatf-greylisting-progress-25-oct-2024 .
November 2024FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW
24
Three of the six outstanding action items relate to South Africa’s ability to 
demonstrate a sustained increase in the investigation and prosecution of complex 
money laundering, terrorist financing and unlicensed cross-border money or value 
transfer services cases. The remaining three relate to the timely access of beneficial 
ownership information in respect of companies and trusts, and the imposition of 
remedial action and dissuasive sanctions by designated anti-money laundering and 
combating the financing of terrorism supervisors. 
According to National Treasury, if South Africa satisfactorily addresses all six 
remaining action items in the next reporting cycle (i.e. by January 2025), the FATF 
Africa Joint Group will conduct an on-site visit during mid-2025 to confirm this 
assessment.20 If the on-site assessment confirms that South Africa has successfully 
addressed all six remaining action items, the FATF Africa Joint Group will recommend 
to the June 2025 FATF Plenary that South Africa be removed from the FATF greylist. 
However, if any of the remaining action items have not been addressed by February 
2025, South Africa will be required to continue reporting back to the FATF Africa 
Joint Group every four months until all the action items have been addressed. Should 
South Africa therefore not exit the greylist in June 2025, the next opportunity to do 
so will be four months later (i.e. in October 2025).
Should South Africa fail to demonstrate sufficient progress to be removed from the 
greylist, domestic financial institutions’ access to the global financial system could 
become increasingly restricted the longer it remains on the greylist. The longer 
South Africa remains on the FATF greylist, the less reliance can be placed on existing 
correspondent banking relationships to mitigate the impact, and the more restrictions 
will start to be imposed by foreign authorities. As international scrutiny intensifies, 
financial institutions and market infrastructure providers in developed markets may 
enhance their risk assessments, leading to enhanced due diligence requirements for 
South African counterparts. As a result, existing facilities may not be renewed, or 
the costs associated with them could increase, making these services economically 
unviable. Such a situation would not only hinder the ability of South African banks to 
secure new facilities, but could also result in foreign financial institutions curtailing or 
even terminating their services in South Africa. 
Remaining on the greylist could also compromise the capacity of South African 
financial institutions to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks as only a 
small number of banks operating in South Africa have the ability to take on significant 
interest rate and foreign exchange risk on their balance sheets. These capabilities 
primarily rest with major global banks that can manage their risk appropriately 
through global diversification. Financial contracts of this nature typically require 
clearing through central clearing counterparties domiciled in major financial centres 
such as London. Prolonged greylisting may impose additional costs and impair 
banks’ ability to hedge risks effectively through offshore markets, impacting their 
capital requirements. This could affect the willingness and ability of banks to provide 
hedging opportunities to domestic clients, ultimately jeopardising risk management 
processes and overall financial stability.

levels of inequality and unemployment. Over the next three years, South Africa’s 
economy is forecast to grow by 1.1% in the 2024/25 fiscal year, 1.7% in 2025/26 and 
1.8% in 2026/27, 21 which is insufficient to bring down unemployment. South Africa’s 
economic performance continues to lag that of EMs (Figure 28). Without a sustained 
improvement in economic growth, many of South Africa’s structural challenges will 
likely remain.

The common financial stability challenges associated with the transition to a net-zero 
economy are relevant to South Africa as detailed in a recent SARB Working Paper 
titled ‘Transition and systemic risk in the South African banking sector: assessment 
and macroprudential options’. 22 The study notes that South Africa’s reliance on coal 
is central to many of the risks it faces in moving to a green economy, finding that 
the banking system’s exposure to transition risks in the corporate sector is both 
material and widespread. While the global transition requires a drastic reduction in 
coal production and utilisation, the South African economy relies heavily on coal, 
both for energy generation and for trade, given that the country is the fifth-largest 
coal exporter globally. In addition, tax revenue from coal exports, coal products and

the mining and quarrying sectors comprises approximately 30% of total company  
tax. However, as global preferences migrate towards greener energy sources, the 
global coal sector will become increasingly irrelevant. If not managed appropriately, 
the transition from fossil fuels to greener energy sources is likely to have structural 
implications for the South African financial sector and for banks in particular.
A cyber incident with systemic impact 
The FSR Act definition of financial stability primarily concerns the ongoing ability of 
financial institutions to deliver financial products and services, even under adverse 
conditions. Although the financial system is bombarded by cyberattacks on a daily 
basis, most of which are warded off or have a limited effect on the system, a cyber 
incident with systemic impact would impede the ability of financial institutions to 
continue operating. The risk of a cyber incident with systemic impact occurring is 
a perpetual one and will become even more relevant as the digital economy grows. 
Potential risk amplifiers would likely result from advances in technology such as 
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, growing market concentration and  
reliance on third-party technology service providers, interconnectivity and 
geopolitical fragmentation. 
One of the ways in which resilience to cyber incidents can be increased is through 
the establishment and operationalisation of cybersecurity incident response teams 
(CSIRTs). To this end, the FSCF’s Cyber Resilience Subcommittee (CRS) has been 
working on establishing and embedding financial sector incident oversight and cyber 
response structures, including the Financial Sector CSIRT (to share threat intelligence 
and collectively respond to cyber incidents in the financial sector) and the Financial 
Sector Overseers CSIRT (to coordinate the efforts of regulators and oversight bodies 
during a cyber incident). Other mitigants include the South African Banking Risk 
Information Centre Banking CSIRT and the Payments Association of South Africa 
incident management process.
Financial stability assessment
The South African financial system has demonstrated remarkable resilience over the 
past several years in the face of global and idiosyncratic factors that threatened the 
domestic financial stability outlook. The outlook for financial stability has improved 
since the release of the June 2024 FSR , largely on the back of positive sentiment 
following the formation of the GNU, the suspension of load-shedding, the expected 
positive impact of the GFECRA distributions in moderating government borrowing, 
and expectations of lower interest rates globally and in South Africa. Steady progress 
continues to be made in increasing the domestic financial system’s resilience against 
the key risks highlighted, most notably by strengthening the domestic financial safety 
net and mitigating the impact of a potential systemic event. Prudentially regulated 
domestic financial institutions, in aggregate, remained resilient, as measured by their 
ability to maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers to absorb the impact of 
shocks. Financial institutions have been able to provide financial services without 
interruption and are expected to continue doing so over the forecast period to 
November 2025.

Policy actions and initiatives undertaken to enhance 
domestic financial stability 
•  Introducing a PCN CCyB: The SARB continued to prepare for the increase in the 
CCyB from 0% to 1% on 1 January 2025. The P A will issue a final directive to give 
effect to the phasing in of the 1% CCyB from 1 January 2025. 
•  Mitigating the sovereign-financial sector nexus:  The SARB continued to closely 
monitor developments around the sovereign-financial sector nexus in particular 
given the high levels of government debt and the domestic financial sector’s 
exposure thereto. 
•  Increasing the financial sector’s resilience to deal with an operational disruption 
with a systemic impact: The SARB, through the FSCF, continued to plan for the 
highly unlikely but not impossible scenario of a national electricity grid shutdown 
and other operational disruptions with a potential systemic impact. 
•  Collaborating with Financial Stability Oversight Committee (FSOC) members: 
The SARB collaborated with FSOC members to discuss some of the key risks to 
financial stability, particularly on the financial stability implications of the weak 
fiscal position and the sovereign-financial sector nexus, the issue of reduced 
market depth and liquidity, and progress made in addressing the deficiencies that 
resulted in South Africa being placed on the FATF greylist.
•  Enhancing cyber-resilience in the financial sector: The FSCF, through the CRS, 
continued to make progress in establishing various CSIRTs for the financial sector.
Briefings on selected topics 
The economic impact of a 1% positive cycle-neutral 
countercyclical capital buffer
In November 2023, the SARB announced its decision to introduce a 1% PCN CCyB 
as a macroprudential instrument. To this end, the PA subsequently published a 
proposed directive giving effect to this decision for comment. 23 The PCN CCyB 
differs from other layers in the capital stack in the sense that it can be increased in 
times when credit growth in the banking sector outpaces general economic activity, 
but also reduced to zero in the event of a shock that constrains bank lending. As a 
macroprudential instrument, the decision to increase or decrease the CCyB is made 
by the SARB’s FSC, without affecting any of the other layers in the capital stack. The 
CCyB has been 0% since its introduction in 2016, nullifying the SARB’s ability to use it 
in a countercyclical manner as intended by releasing it during times of stress.
Over the past several years, the SARB has conducted various studies on the potential 
economic impact of implementing a 1% PCN CCyB. 24 The studies consider how an 
increase in bank capital requirements affects lending supply and macroeconomic 
activity more broadly. While the key focus of these studies is on the bank lending 
channel, they also capture the impact that the proposed capital requirement change 
will have on the real economy. Overall, the results suggest that the introduction of a 
1% PCN CCyB would have a marginal and temporary impact, and not severe enough 
to outweigh the long-term financial stability benefits that a countercyclical policy 
tool brings.

More and better liquidity: the changing composition 
of high-quality liquid assets in South Africa
Through the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rules set by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (BCBS), banks are required to hold HQLA. HQLA can be easily 
and immediately converted into cash at little or no loss of value. An asset’s liquidity 
depends on the underlying stress scenario, the value to be monetised and the time 
frame over which it is to be realised. In South Africa, the set of HQLA-eligible assets 
currently comprises (i) banknotes and coin; (ii) highly-rated non-government debt; 
(iii) central bank reserves; (iv) government and SARB rand-denominated debt; and 
(v) government and SARB foreign exchange-denominated debt (for specific 
exposures). To satisfy the LCR, banks must hold sufficient unencumbered HQLA 
to meet all outflow demands, for a period of 30 calendar days, during episodes of 
stress.25 
In South Africa, approximately 75% of HQLA is government bonds and Treasury 
bills. The fact that the bulk of HQLA is government debt instruments raises some 
concerns. South African government debt is no longer rated investment grade by 
global measures and may lose notable value in a crisis. This vulnerability would be 
exacerbated if debt owners engaged in fire sales to raise liquidity, further reducing 
its value. Heavy reliance by banks on government debt for HQLA is therefore a 
contributor to the financial stability vulnerabilities associated with the sovereign-
financial sector nexus, an issue discussed in previous editions of the FSR .26 
Banks’ growing exposure to the sovereign attracted attention when the PA ended 
banks’ exemption to hold foreign-currency assets against rand-based liquidity needs 
from 2024 (as specified in Banks Act Directive 11 of 2022). This change achieved 
compliance with the BCBS rules, but may have contributed to encouraging banks 
to increase their South African sovereign exposure in pursuit of increasing their 
HQLA holdings. 
Nonetheless, as Table 1 shows, the share of government debt in Level 1 HQLA 
decreased by nearly 0.5% between 2021 and 2024. This occurred despite a significant 
– and expected – fall in non-government debt in Level 1 HQLA (down nearly 6% 
between 2021 and 2024). Over the same period, the contribution of banknotes and 
coin to Level 1 HQLA also moderated by nearly 1%, which is consistent with the 
declining cash intensity of the South African economy.
Table 1: Changes in the composition of HQLA, 2021–2024
Components of Level 1 HQLA July 2021 July 2024 Change
Banknotes and coin 2.5% 1.8% -0.7%

The main offsetting factor has been growth in central bank reserves, which increased 
by almost 6% between 2021 and 2024. While these balances have long featured 
in banks’ HQLA given the cash reserve requirement, they have become a more 
important source of HQLA since the introduction of the SARB’s new monetary policy 
implementation framework (MPIF) in 2022. 27 
From 1998 to 2022, the SARB implemented monetary policy through a scarcity 
system, that is, by draining enough liquidity from the market to force banks to borrow 
at weekly repurchase (repo) auctions to satisfy their cash reserve requirements. The 
liabilities issued by the SARB to drain this liquidity mostly did not qualify as HQLA.  
The 2022 MPIF reform, however, established a surplus system. The SARB expanded 
the supply of liquidity and provided banks with a deposit facility that paid the repo rate 
(i.e. the policy rate). This allowed banks to maintain larger cash deposits at the SARB 
without incurring a penalty. The liquidity surplus grew further with the drawdown of 
the National Treasury Sterilisation Deposit Account in early 2023 and the distribution 
of GFECRA funds in mid-2024.  The supply of excess GFECRA reserves has now risen 
to around R160 billion, from roughly R45 billion in late 2022.
Before the MPIF reform, banks’ cash reserves with the SARB were around 12% of total 
Level 1 HQLA held by banks. Following the GFECRA distribution, they are now over 
20% (Figure 29). This has contributed to the banking sector holding historically high 
levels of HQLA (Figure 30).

Central bank reserves have several advantages as HQLA. They always trade at face 
value, with no credit or interest rate risk, and do not experience fire sales. Unlike other 
HQLA instruments, there are also no logistical frictions in monetising them – they are 
already cash balances held within the payment system. While this is no silver bullet, 
a larger supply of this asset helps mitigate the sovereign-financial sector nexus in 
South Africa by improving the supply and quality of HQLA.

An assessment of vulnerabilities in the South African 
commercial real estate sector and the financial stability 
implications28 
The SARB assessed vulnerabilities in the South African commercial real estate (CRE) 
sector and its implications for financial stability. The assessment found that financial 
imbalances within the South African CRE sector have significantly increased since the 
COVID-19 pandemic, with vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change. Meanwhile 
the banking sector’s exposure to CRE has also declined, indicating tighter lending 
standards. Although this is positive for financial stability from a bank credit risk 
perspective, it has contributed to growing financing challenges for the sector. The 
findings indicate a decline in capital growth and transaction activity due to higher 
borrowing costs. Higher interest rates have also led to a deterioration in banks’ CRE 
asset quality. While investors may incur large financial losses in the event of market 
shocks, systemic risks appear limited due to the relatively low direct exposure of the 
financial system to the CRE sector.
The South African CRE sector is under pressure, both from a cost and income 
perspective.  From a cost perspective, significant investments in alternative electricity 
supply are required, and municipal rates and taxes have increased at a much faster 
pace than rental income. Water supply is also a concern in some areas. Moreover, 
physical risks stemming from climate change present a significant challenge for the 
CRE sector, impacting property values and increasing insurance costs.29 Construction 
activity is at an all-time low, as depressed asset values and rising construction costs 
have made new developments financially unfeasible.
Various factors contribute to lower rental income, which in turn affect property 
valuations and the ability of owners to cover operational, maintenance and debt-
service costs. The shift to e-commerce and work-from-home models caused a 
structural decline in demand for retail and office space resulting in higher vacancy 
rates. Although this shift was triggered by the COVID-19 lockdowns, and despite 
the fact that most organisations have reverted to a hybrid working model, rental 
demand remains subdued. While Figure 3 1A shows a sharp increase in vacancies 
due to COVID-19-related factors, it is noteworthy that vacancy rates had already 
been gradually rising since 2009, as new developments outpaced the demand for 
new property. 
A high vacancy rate above the pre-COVID-19 level exerts pressure on office rental 
prices. Although there are signs of recovery in vacancy rates, they have yet to return 
to pre-pandemic levels, and this continues to exert pressure on real rental prices 
(Figure 3 1D). However, there are notable differences in trends among provinces. 
The trend of s emigration30 to Cape Town has resulted in a stronger recovery in 
vacancy rates (Figure 31A) and real rentals (Figures 31B and 31C) for Grade A offices 
in the Western Cape region.

In addition to vacancy rates, tenant payment behaviour exacerbates the decline in rental 
income. The variability in tenant payment patterns is influenced by factors such as 
property rates and taxes, which vary across different geographical areas. While some 
recent recovery is noted, tenants in good standing (tenants who consistently meet their 
lease obligations) remain well below the pre-COVID-19 level (Figure 31C). Defaults by 
tenants can reduce rental income and induce a cycle of debt defaults.

risks. Commercial mortgages as a share of total lending continued on a downward 
trend in the post-pandemic period (Figure 32A). The bulk of CRE specialised lending 
was to income-producing real estate (IPRE), which relies on income from underlying 
properties or businesses to repay loans, increasing the risk of default in a downturn 
(Figure 32B). Year-on-year growth in credit extended in the CRE sector plummeted 
drastically in the first three quarters of 2020 due to the financial fallout from the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The downward trend moderated somewhat until 
the third quarter of 2021. As restrictions to economic activity were gradually relaxed, 
credit extension to the CRE sector regained momentum, growing at around 15% year 
on year at the end of 2023. The credit quality of CRE assets continues to deteriorate  
(Figure 32C) – albeit more moderately in recent months, as seen by a moderation in the 
specific impairments (Figure 32D) – due to the COVID-19-induced structural changes 
in the sector coupled with persistently weak economic growth.

Global and domestic conditions in the CRE markets are currently in a downward 
phase, which poses several financial stability concerns. The structural growth 
constraints interacting with higher interest rates have skewed the supply and demand 
dynamics in the CRE sector, negatively impacting cash flows and property values. In 
response to this and potential future stress, investment and lending activities are 
deteriorating. Since the COVID-19 impact, financial imbalances in the domestic CRE 
sector have grown but are differentiated across segments, with the office segment 
being the worst affected. Rising incidences of extreme weather have further 
negatively impacted all channels of transmission of CRE vulnerabilities. Domestically, 
financial and non-financial institutions face potential credit losses from the exposure 
to the CRE sector. While investors could face large losses, systemic risks currently 
appear limited.

circumstances, and without a loss of general confidence in the ability of financial 
institutions and financial market infrastructures to do so. 
•  Vulnerability: A characteristic of the financial system that increases the likelihood 
and/or impact of a financial stability risk realising. 
• Shock: An event that may trigger the realisation of financial stability risk. 
• Amplifier: A property, factor or action that increases the vulnerability. 
• Mitigant: A property, factor or action that reduces the vulnerability. 
•  Transmission channels or mechanisms:  The channels through which the 
materialisation of a financial stability risk could cause financial instability. 
• Residual vulnerability:  The assessed vulnerability after considering mitigants.

Annexure A: Financial stability heatmap
The SARB uses a wide range of financial stability indicators that are designed to act 
as early warning signals of a potential build-up of cyclical changes in the financial 
system that could lead to vulnerabilities if left unattended. A ‘snapshot’ of all material 
developments is communicated through the financial stability heatmap. The heatmap 
visually depicts the statistical transformation of a wide range of financial stability 
indicators against their historical averages. It is data driven and based on historical 
information, and does not contain any evaluation of financial stability risks. It serves 
as a communication tool to flag areas for deeper analyses. 31 
Not every indicator used in the construction of the heatmap is discussed in the 
FSR. Rather, the focus is on key global and domestic factors that may be relevant to 
financial stability risks and vulnerabilities in South Africa. The potential build-up of 
imbalances as reflected in the heatmap is discussed in detail in the write-up of the 
key risks identified as per the SARB RVM. 
31  In an effort to continually improve the reliability of the indicators used in the heatmap and to keep them 
relevant, they are reviewed and updated from time to time.
