preface
the primary mandate of the (sarb) is to achieve and maintain price stability in the interest of 
balanced and sustainable economic growth. in addition, the sarb has a complementary mandate to oversee and maintain 
financial stability.
price stability helps to protect the purchasing power and living standards of all south africans. it provides a favourable 
environment for investment and job creation and supports international competitiveness. the goal of price stability is quantified 
through an inflation target, which is set in consultation with government. the target is a band of 3–6%, which has been in 
place since 2000. 
the sarb has full operational independence. monetary policy decisions are made by the sarb’s monetary policy committee 
(mpc), which is chaired by the governor and includes the deputy governors and other senior officials of the sarb.
the inflation-targeting framework is flexible, meaning that policymakers will seek to look through temporary shocks, thereby 
avoiding excessive volatility in interest rates and economic output. the mpc takes a forward-looking approach to account for 
the time lags between policy adjustments and economic effects. mpc decisions are communicated at a press conference at 
the end of each meeting, accompanied by a comprehensive statement.
the monetary policy review (mpr) is published twice a year and is aimed at broadening the public’s understanding of 
the objectives and conduct of monetary policy. the mpr covers domestic and international developments that affect the 
monetary policy stance. 
the mpr is presented by senior officials of the sarb at monetary policy forum meetings held at major centres across south 
africa in an effort to develop a better understanding of monetary policy through direct interactions with stakeholders.

executive summary and 
overview of the policy stance
headline inflation cooled markedly in the second half of 2024, 
pulling the average for the year down to 4.4% from 6.0% the 
year before. lower fuel, food and core price inflation improved 
the outlook and helped inflation expectations ease significantly. 
the monetary policy committee (mpc) cut rates by 50 basis 
points to 7.5% in the six months from october 2024 to march 
2025 (the review period). headline inflation is projected to 
average 3.6% this year and to revert to around the 4.5% target 
midpoint from 2026. however, inflation risks remain, and 
high global economic uncertainty has reduced confidence 
in the medium-term inflation outlook. global macroeconomic 
risks have heightened amid tariff increases and geopolitical 
tensions, while inflation has still not fallen to pre-pandemic 
levels. services inflation in major advanced economies remains 
above target rates and policy rates are likely to remain higher 
for longer. regarding domestic output, despite the downside 
risks, ongoing reforms in the energy and logistics sectors, along 
with improvements in household real disposable income, are 
forecast to lift growth to 1.7% this year, rising to 2.0% by 2027.
global economic developments
global headline inflation continued to ease from its 2022 peak 
of 8.6%, decreasing to 6.7% in 2023 and 5.8% in 2024. for 
2025, global headline inflation is forecast to be 4.2 %, with 
a further decline to 3.5% in 2026. 1 the trajectory of global 
inflation has been shaped primarily by moderating food and 
fuel prices, while global supply chains and shipping costs 
continued to stabilise. restrictive monetary policy also cooled 
price pressures, especially in core goods, by bringing demand 
and supply into better balance. however, the global headline 
inflation outturn for 2024 was 0.4  percentage points higher 
than projected in the international monetary fund’s (imf) 
october 2024 world economic outlook (weo) , and forecasts 
for 2025 have been volatile. the disinflation process has clearly 
slowed, the question is whether it has stalled entirely and is at 
risk of reversal.2 
inflation remains above the targets of most major advanced 
economies. robust services consumption demand and strong 
wage growth from tight labour markets have underpinned 
persistence in services price inflation. meanwhile, declining 
inflation and interest rate cuts have boosted real household 
spending power and, together with sustained government 
spending, have supported demand growth. some emerging

market economies, including brazil, have also grappled with 
strong demand-driven inflation pressures, despite tighter 
monetary policy settings.
moving beyond demand and supply challenges to inflation, 
global disinflation faces new obstacles. escalating trade 
tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation, reflected primarily 
in rising tariffs, have raised global economic policy uncertainty 
to levels last seen during the covid-19 pandemic. the risk of 
disruptions to global supply chains and broader trade policy 
uncertainty have increased sharply, offsetting the cooling 
effects of weaker job growth on inflation. for the first time 
in several years, the risk that disinflation at a global level will 
stall, if not reverse, has increased sharply. as a consequence, 
market views of risk and short-term rate expectations have 
shifted higher. recession risk has, however, also increased, as 
higher tariffs on global trade also carry the potential for much 
weaker economic growth. 
with inflation stubborn and new risks emerging, central 
banks have moved cautiously. the united states (us) federal 
reserve (fed) and the bank of england (boe) have cut rates by 
100 basis points and 75 basis points respectively so far, much 
less than anticipated at the time of the previous monetary policy 
review (mpr). the european central bank (ecb) has lowered 
rates more, given slow growth and better inflation outcomes. 3 
japan has been an exception among the major economies, 
raising rates by a cumulative 60 basis points since march 2024 
as inflation finally returned after decades of deflation. 
across emerging markets, restrictive monetary policy, less 
labour market pressure, and subdued food and fuel price 
increases have also resulted in better inflation outcomes. these 
factors have enabled emerging market central banks to ease 
rates but they have, on average, cut rates less than advanced 
economies, reflecting greater volatility in inflation. some 
economies, in particular brazil and russia, have hiked rates 
amid signs of de-anchoring inflation expectations. meanwhile, 
rates in south africa have been reduced by 75 basis points 
over the past year as inflation and inflation expectations have 
moderated, with a relatively benign medium-term outlook.
the slower pace of disinflation around the world reflects 
both near-term factors, such as macroeconomic policy 
settings, and longer-term drivers, such as demographics and 
productivity growth. 4 together they help shape how central 
3 the ecb has lowered rates by a cumulative 150 basis points since 
june 2024. market-implied rate expectations in october 2024 
suggested the fed would cut rates by a cumulative 275 basis points 
by december 2025 and the ecb by a cumulative 200 basis points 
by september 2025.

and neutral real interest rates: past and future’, national bureau 
of economic research working paper no. 31949 , cambridge:

banks think about the neutral level of interest rates and assess 
policy settings in relation to them. given extraordinarily high 
uncertainty and new risks to inflation, central banks will likely 
remain data-dependent and expand the use of scenarios to 
understand alternative economic paths and to assess risks.
despite the shifting balance of inflation risks, modest policy 
adjustments by major central banks are still expected this 
year. nevertheless, rates are likely to remain above their pre-
pandemic levels for longer, as central banks look to settle and 
anchor inflation at targets.
the decline in global inflation over the past year was 
accompanied by a modest softening in global growth to 3.2% 
in 2024 from 3.3% the year before, sustaining a trajectory 
from the post-pandemic recovery. 5 however, the fall in 
south africa’s trading-partner growth was much larger, with 
economic activity expanding by only 2.5% in 2024, down from 
3.1% in the previous year. this sharp decline reflects slower 
growth in south africa’s key trading partners, namely sub-
saharan africa (ssa), the eurozone and china. 6 the us was 
an exception, with the economy expanding by a solid 2.8% in 
2024. nevertheless, recent us high-frequency data suggests 
growth could be less robust this year. 7 looking ahead, the 
 (sarb) projects trading-partner 
growth to rebound to 3.1% this year, rising marginally to 3.2% 
by 2027.
risks to global economic activity were tilted to the downside 
for much of the past six months, and are now aggravated by 
recent developments. trade tensions are expected to deepen 
geoeconomic fragmentation, disrupt supply chains and restrict 
market access – dampening private investment, consumption, 
and growth. the impact of tariff hikes on global growth and 
inflation is potentially large, with estimates ranging widely 
depending on how they are implemented. 8 
domestic economic 
developments and outlook
with the large influence of food and fuel price changes in 
global and domestic inflation, south africa’s headline inflation 
has broadly tracked global outcomes. however, domestic 
inflation came out somewhat below forecast in the second 
half of 2024. after averaging 5.3 % in the first six months of 
5 imf, weo update, washington dc: imf, january 2025.
6 ssa grew by 3.8% in 2024 and the eurozone and china by 0.8% 
and 4.8% respectively – well below long-term averages.
7 recent us sentiment indicators and high-frequency activity data 
softened unexpectedly, along with growth expectations, while the 
us dollar weakened. meanwhile, stimulus measures in germany 
(targeted at infrastructure and defence) and china are expected to 
boost growth in these economies. see, for instance, bbva research, 
‘china economic outlook’, madrid: bbva research, 13 march 2025.
8 according to the kiel institute, a 25% tariff increase on all eurozone 
imports to the us could reduce growth in the short term by 0.4 and 
0.2 percentage points for the eurozone and us respectively, rising 
to around 0.5 and 0.3 percentage points respectively with retaliatory 
measures. see kiel institute for the world economy, ‘trump’s tariff 
threats on eu could trigger economic turmoil’. media release, 
berlin: kiel institute for the world economy, 27 february 2025.

the year, inflation decelerated quickly, slowing to below the 
lower limit of the target band in october and november, before 
edging back into the target band from december. at 3.2% in 
february 2025, inflation is presently subdued. both services 
and goods price inflation have softened, with services easing 
to 3.8% in february  2025 from 4.4% in september  2024, and 
goods moderating to 2.5% from 3.3% over the same period . 
the marked deceleration in goods inflation was on account of 
lower food price increases and fuel price deflation, reflecting 
a stronger rand exchange rate, lower brent crude oil prices 
as well as base effects. monetary policy also helped slow the 
rate of price increases by containing demand at a time when 
supply was constrained and curbing second-round effects 
from earlier rises in food, fuel and electricity inflation. the 
sharply lower inflation readings in the final quarter of the year 
helped pull the headline inflation average down to 4.4% for the 
full year, from 6.0% in 2023.
looking ahead, headline inflation is expected to rise gradually 
as fuel, food and other inflation components normalise. 
upward price pressures will also emanate from the proposed 
value-added tax (vat) increases of 0.5 percentage points per 
year over the next two years. the sarb projects an addition of 
0.2 percentage points to headline inflation per year from the 
vat increases. the precise impact of the vat increases on 
inflation will, however, depend on the extent to which sellers 
pass on the increases to consumers. 9 meanwhile, unit labour 
cost (ulc) growth is expected to remain muted. similarly, 
inflation expectations have eased closer to the target midpoint 
and may moderate further, supporting a slower rise in services 
inflation. the inflation profile also benefits from a relatively stable 
rand exchange rate, less steep electricity price increases than 
previously assumed and a lower oil price assumption. headline 
inflation appears little affected by statistics south africa’s 
(stats sa) recent adjustment to the consumer price index (cpi) 
basket and its weightings.
overall, headline inflation is projected to average 3.6% this year 
before reverting to around the target midpoint over the medium 
term. the trajectory of core inflation is broadly similar to that of 
headline inflation, although core goods inflation shows a slight 
target overshoot in 2026 and 2027 on account of currency 
weakness and vat increases. other domestic risks include 
administered price increases and wage growth in excess of 
productivity gains. risks emanating from the global environment 
include tariff increases and heightened global uncertainty 
leading to further currency depreciation (see box 7).
9 two vat increases of 0.5 percentage points each are expected to 
become effective on 1 may 2025 and 1 april 2026. each vat increase 
is expected to add 0.2 percentage points to headline inflation over the 
12-month implementation period. the 0.2 percentage points estimate 
assumes that about three-quarters of the increase will pass through to 
prices, in line with estimates of the 2018 vat pass-through effect. this 
estimate does not fully account for possible second-round effects. see

domestic economic activity has been subdued over the past 
two years. after a strong covid-19 rebound to 5.0% in 2021, 
output growth slowed to 1.9% in 2022. economic activity 
slowed further to 0.7% in 2023 and to 0.6% last year. the slow 
growth largely reflects the marked decline in the performance 
of key state-owned network industries, with severe load-
shedding and logistical challenges hampering economic 
activity and reducing the potential growth rate of the economy. 
high production costs and a loss of competitiveness have also 
dragged down output growth.
looking at demand and spending, a decline in imports and 
more-robust-than-expected export prices, alongside sustained 
but modest household spending, contributed positively. import 
volumes fell more than exports, mainly because of weaker 
investment demand and reduced spending on oil, improving 
the contribution of net exports to growth. meanwhile, lower 
inflation, the two-pot retirement system withdrawals and 
interest rate cuts lifted household consumption spending. 
government spending also supported growth in 2024, albeit 
marginally, consistent with fiscal consolidation. growth in real 
gross fixed capital formation (gfcf) was, however, poor. all 
components of gfcf detracted from growth in 2024 and 
remained well below their 2019 levels. 
looking ahead, household spending is expected to underpin 
economic activity in the near and medium term, benefiting from 
low inflation and reduced borrowing costs. two-pot retirement 
system withdrawals are expected to continue, although their 
impact is likely to diminish over time. however, the tax increases 
(vat and fiscal drag) announced in the 2025 budget should 
moderate growth in household spending. 10 at the same time, 
ongoing reforms in ports and rail, together with maintenance 
by eskom and transmission system development, should 
gradually ease supply bottlenecks and spur investment. after 
contracting by 3.7% in 2024, investment growth is expected to 
rebound to 2.1% this year and rise to 3.6% by the end of the 
forecast period, underpinned by both the public and private 
sectors.11 the contribution of government spending to growth 
over the medium term is projected to be broadly neutral.
growth in gross domestic product (gdp) is projected to rise 
to 1.7% this year, while potential growth in 2025 is forecast to 
strengthen to 1.4%. actual and potential growth are expected 
to converge over the medium term, averaging 1.9% per year. 
while the attainment of these growth rates would mark a 
significant shift in the economy’s gdp trajectory, they remain 
below south africa’s long-run growth rate of 2.5% and are 
far lower than the average for emerging markets of 4.2 %. 
domestic growth can be boosted further by adopting policy 
measures that permanently lower inflation risk and strengthen 
competitiveness.
10 overall, household spending is expected to increase by 2.0% this year 
and to average 1.8% over the outer years of the forecast period.

overview of the policy stance
the mpc lowered the policy rate by 50 basis points over the 
review period, bringing it to 7.5%. the rate adjustments are 
consistent with the policy rate path implied by the quarterly 
projection model (qpm).
inflation forecasts at the november  2024 and january  2025 
mpc meetings were favourable, reflecting muted domestic 
price pressures and inflation expectations around the 
target midpoint. however, the medium term appeared more 
uncertain than usual due to rising global trade tensions and 
economic uncertainty. rand depreciation risk on account 
of elevated interest rates or policy reversals, especially in 
advanced economies, was also flagged. at the january mpc 
meeting, higher prices for food, electricity and water as well 
as insurance premiums and wage settlements were noted as 
medium-term inflation risks. some of these risks were captured 
and evaluated in forecast scenarios. the mpc found risks to 
be balanced at the november 2024 meeting but tilted to the 
upside at its january 2025 meeting.
by the march  2025 mpc meeting, some risks flagged in 
previous meetings had materialised, including trade tensions 
and higher-than-expected public sector wage growth . new 
risks included a staggered 1.0 percentage point vat increase 
over two years announced in the 2025 budget. the medium-
term outlook, however, remained moderate and in line with 
previous forecasts. downward revisions to electricity tariff 
increases and oil price assumptions helped pull the headline 
inflation trajectory marginally lower.12 nevertheless, uncertainty 
around the inflation outlook from global factors was assessed to 
be unusually high. domestic uncertainties had also increased, 
particularly as the 2025 budget process remained incomplete. 
overall, risks were seen to both sides in the near term, with a 
skew to the upside in the policy-relevant medium-term horizon. 
accordingly, the mpc kept the policy rate unchanged at its 
march 2025 meeting.
monetary policy always involves making decisions under 
uncertainty, particularly in an environment of rising risks and 
a higher long-term inflation-neutral rate. the three successive 
rate cuts since the september  2024 mpc meeting have 
progressively reduced the degree of policy restrictiveness, 
with the inflation-adjusted real rate declining to 3.2% in the first 
quarter of this year, from 5.1% in the third quarter of 2024. 13 
compared to an estimated real neutral rate of approximately 
3.0%, this reflects significant unwinding of policy restrictiveness. 
accordingly, policy is now assessed to be near neutral.
12 relative to the january forecast, headline inflation is 0.3 percentage 
points and 0.1 percentage points lower in 2025 and 2026 respectively 
in the march forecast.
13 this is calculated as the nominal policy rate less expected inflation 
four quarters ahead.

conclusion
rising global tariffs and possible countervailing measures 
present risks to the outlook for global growth and inflation, 
threatening deeper stagflation. with such high global policy 
uncertainty and risks, confidence around how the medium-
term outlook will play out is reduced. broadly speaking, central 
banks will remain ‘cautious and data-dependent’ until clearer 
data emerges that increases confidence about the path over 
the medium term. in some instances, interest rates are likely to 
stay elevated for an extended period.
exiting the combination of low growth and higher than desired 
inflation is never straightforward, particularly where negative 
supply shocks abound. the resilience of the south african 
economy from external and domestic shocks can be enhanced 
by sustaining domestic reform momentum. this entails both 
structural reforms to enhance the economy’s productive 
capacity and efforts to rebuild fiscal and monetary policy space. 
other important measures include macroeconomic reforms to 
bring domestic inflation closer to that of trading partners to 
permanently lower inflation risk and improve competitiveness.

and economics discussion series 2024-043, washington dc: board of

the phillips curve posits a short-run trade-off between economic 
slack and inflation, suggesting that reducing inflation comes at a cost 
to output. 1 however, phillips curves shift over time with changes in 
economic conditions and the public’s perception of central bank anti-
inflation credibility.2 greater central bank credibility flattens the phillips 
curve, reducing the impact of growth on inflation. when this relationship 
is weak, economic agents are said to be ‘rationally inattentive’ to 
inflationary shocks, not changing their investment or spending decisions 
in response to changes in a more stable inflation rate.
the south african phillips curve appears to show four distinct changes 
in slope. in the early 2000s, inflation expectations were not yet well 
anchored, and inflation shocks fed strongly through to inflation. 
however, with monetary policy credibility improving quickly, by 2004 
inflation expectations had become better anchored and the slope was 
flatter – a trend that carried through to 2009. the post-global financial 
crisis period (2010–19) showed the flattest average slope. 3 inflation 
expectations first became anchored around the upper limit of the target 
band but later moved significantly lower following the south african 
reserve bank’s (sarb) 2017 communication preference for inflation 
to be at the 4.5% midpoint. the 2017–19 experience illustrated that 
effective communication and healthy credibility reduces the trade-off, as 
reflected in the flatter curve.4
after covid-19, the worsening inflation surge resulted in a de-
anchoring of inflation expectations and a steeper slope. but the steeper 
curve implies that monetary policy can reduce inflation faster and with 
limited effects on output – achieving a soft landing. 5 indeed, south 
africa raised rates much less than its peers at the height of the inflation 
surge, minimising output costs. as inflation and inflation expectations 
re-anchor at the sarb’s preferred midpoint, the slope of the phillips 
curve is again expected to flatten.

box 2 scenario use under uncertainty
1 the november 2024 mpc meeting considered a higher administered 
price scenario and scenarios that assumed an escalation/de-escalation of 
global geopolitical tensions. similarly, the january 2025 mpc meeting also 
considered multiple scenarios, including a global trade war and faster pace 
of reform implementation in the domestic economy.
2 in his recent review of the bank of england’s forecasting framework, former 
us federal reserve chair ben bernanke recommended greater use of 
scenarios to assess risks and reduce the over-dependence of decisions on 
the central projection, which may be erroneous.
the monetary policy committee (mpc) regularly employs forecast 
scenarios to better understand the risks to its baseline forecasts. two 
such scenarios were considered at the march 2025 mpc meeting. 1 
the first scenario considered tariffs on south african−united states 
(us) trade, while the second explored a weaker us dollar and higher 
commodity prices. 2
scenario 1: tariffs on south african−us trade
consistent with the tariff rates proposed for other us trading partners, 
a 25% tariff increase was modelled on all south african imports into the 
us. three possible sub-scenarios were considered:
i. the african growth and opportunity act (agoa) is terminated 
without retaliatory tariffs.
ii. agoa is terminated alongside the imposition of a 25% tariff on 
south african exports.
iii. similar to the second sub-scenario, with the addition of a 15% 
rand depreciation caused by risk premium spillovers.
scenario 2: weaker us dollar and higher commodity prices
this scenario assumed a 5% us dollar depreciation against the 
euro and a 10% rise in commodity prices (level shift) throughout the 
forecast period

global economy: into 
the great unknown 
the global economy is confronted with unusually high 
uncertainty amid shifting trade policies and elevated 
geopolitical tensions. trade tensions could depress economic 
activity and raise supply costs. world economic activity is 
expected to increase at a steady pace of 3.3% this year and 
the next, with risks tilted to the downside. inflation also faces 
new risks due to the potentially disruptive effects of tariff 
hikes on supply chains and trade, while risks related to sticky 
services pressures persist. this threatens to stall or reverse 
the disinflation of the past two years, achieved on account of 
tight monetary policy and favourable price developments in 
fuel, food and core goods. although policy rates are expected 
to decline further in major economies, the new risks that have 
emerged suggest they will remain higher for longer.
over the past five years, the world economy has endured a 
series of overlapping shocks. it started with the covid-19 
pandemic and its aftermath, including the surge in inflation. 
this was followed by russia’s war in ukraine (which is partly 
responsible for the 2022 inflation surge) and geopolitical 
tensions in the middle east. more recently, global trade tensions 
have escalated, raising uncertainty to levels not seen since the 
pandemic. these adverse events significantly impacted global 
economic activity, with growth remaining below pre-pandemic 
levels. despite these challenges, the global economy expanded 
by 3.2% last year – a similar pace as in 2023.
growth in world economic activity is projected to stabilise at 
3.3% in 2025 and 2026, remaining below its pre-covid-19 
average of 3.7%. 14 rising uncertainty is expected to weigh 
on activity as firms and households adopt a wait-and-see 
approach to investment and spending decisions. although 
weak demand and trade restrictions are expected to hamper 
manufacturing, global growth should, nonetheless, continue to 
benefit from resilience in the services sector.
among the major advanced economies, the us’s economic 
performance was exceptional last year as its economy grew 
above its long-term trend, while most other economies 
struggled. after expanding by 2.8% in 2024, the us economy 
may again outperform its peers this year, depending on 
consumer demand and investment appetite. however, us 
tariffs on its major trading partners and potential retaliatory 
measures pose downside risks to us economic activity. 
uncertainty around tariff policies, signs of weaker consumer 
spending, and declining consumer and business sentiment 
have reignited recessionary fears.

in the eurozone, economic activity remains sluggish amid 
weak fixed investment and poor manufacturing performance. 
growth in germany has been weighed down by weak demand 
and ailing manufacturing conditions, with the automotive 
sector facing challenges from the shift to electric vehicles, 
growing competition from china as well as rising protectionism. 
household spending in the eurozone has been muted amid 
rising savings; however, easing monetary conditions should 
provide some impetus to spending over the medium term. 15 
real gdp is projected to expand by a modest 1.0% this year 
from 0.8% in 2024, although plans to increase defence and 
infrastructure spending across europe could boost growth 
from 2026.
in the united kingdom (uk), growth is forecast to accelerate to 
1.6% this year, as real income gains and declining interest rates 
support spending. japan’s total output is seen to expand by 
1.1% this year, underpinned by increased capital investment 
and improved consumer spending amid rising wages.
divergent growth is also evident across emerging markets. 
china’s economy is projected to slow to 4.6% this year 
from 5.0% in 2024, despite recent fiscal support measures. 
demand remains weak due to the delayed recovery in the 
property sector and subdued consumer confidence. china’s 
growth outlook remains highly uncertain, with significant 
downside risks related to us trade relations. india is expected 
to remain one of the fastest-growing economies in the world 
this year, expanding at 6.5%. robust private consumption 
and investment underpin the forecast. meanwhile, in latin 
america, growth is projected to recover only marginally to 
2.5% this year, weighed by slowdowns in the region’s largest 
economies – brazil and mexico. 16 economic activity in ssa is 
forecast to rise by 4.2% in 2025, owing to strong growth in 
several smaller economies. the larger economies of nigeria 
and south africa are seen to expand by 3.2% and 1.5% 
respectively this year.
risks to the global growth outlook are tilted to the downside. 
rising trade protectionism and threats as well as geopolitical 
realignments could disrupt trade flows. additionally, debt 
levels remain a concern. however, there are also upside risks, 
such as a potential ceasefire in ukraine, which could reduce 
geopolitical tensions and put some downward pressure on 
commodity prices.

16 brazil’s economy is expected to weaken to 2.2% in 2025 from 3.7% in 
2024, while mexico’s economy is forecast to slow to 1.4% in 2025 from 
1.8% the year before as consumption and investment growth slow .

inflation: uncertainty is the 
only certainty 
after a sharp deceleration from mid-2022 due to monetary 
policy tightening and the unwinding of supply shocks, the 
disinflation process stalled somewhat in major advanced 
economies during the six-month review period. persistent 
inflation in services prices and still-high wage growth continue 
to limit disinflationary momentum, while rising goods inflation 
− along with the looming trade tensions − threaten to reverse 
these trends. in the us, elevated food inflation has added to 
price pressures, slowing the rate of decline in headline inflation. 
in the eurozone, however, disinflation remains largely on track 
amid relatively softer demand and a stronger euro as well as 
lower energy prices. japan, however, has been experiencing 
rising inflation, owing to a depreciated yen and a relatively tight 
labour market. 
across many advanced economies, labour markets have 
become less tight, which is expected to exert more 
disinflationary pressure to inflation as labour market slack 
increases. vacancy rates have declined closer to pre-covid-19 
averages. in the us, monthly payrolls have been moderating 
since the beginning of the year, while the unemployment rate 
has edged higher. although layoffs of us government workers 
are likely to add to the cooling job market, this could be offset 
by changes in immigration policies.17 
tariff-related price increases remain a major upside risk to 
the global inflation outlook. in the us, for instance, tariffs 
are estimated to push personal consumption expenditure 
(pce) inflation up by between 1.0 and 1.2 percentage points 
in the short term. 18 in those sectors where us import-
substitution is low – such as recreational goods, education and 
communication goods, and household furnishings – tariffs are 
expected to result in higher goods prices. indeed, us short-
term inflation expectations have been revised higher, even as 
longer-term forecasts have remained stable. 19 similarly, in the 
eurozone, short-term inflation forecasts have shifted higher, 
while longer-term expectations remain anchored at 2.0%.
17 in february 2025, us employers announced 172 017 layoffs, a 245% 
increase from the previous month and the highest monthly increase 
since july 2020, according to us challenger, gray and christmas. the 
government sector had the most layoffs, accounting for 36% of the total.
18 the budget lab at yale, ‘the fiscal, economic and distributional 
effects of 20% tariffs on china and 25% tariffs on canada 
and mexico’, new haven: yale university, march 2025. the 
analysis suggests that recent tariff increases could raise the us 
effective tariff rate to its highest level since the early-1940s.
19 the university of michigan’s 3- and 5-year inflation projections have risen 
steadily, while 10-year-ahead forecasts have been stable. survey-based 
forecasts of 1-year-ahead us inflation have also been revised higher, 
while 10-year-ahead projections have remained stable near 2.0%.

disinflation has continued in emerging markets, despite 
currency weakness and other idiosyncratic factors. in brazil 
and mexico, however, disinflation appears to be stalling, 
mainly due to expansionary fiscal policy and large currency 
deprecations. across emerging asia, inflation has also slowed 
appreciably and is expected to remain very low in china.20 the 
outlook, however, remains subject to significant uncertainties 
surrounding tariffs and other policies from major economies.
monetary policy to remain cautious
inflation in many countries continues to face upside risks, 
owing to weak productivity growth, currency volatility and 
trade fragmentation. elevated debt levels add to currency risk 
and thus inflationary pressures. these factors, along with the 
rise in short-term inflation expectations, highlight the fragility of 
the current disinflation process. the highly uncertain economic 
environment implies wider uncertainty bands around inflation 
projections and suggests a more cautious approach by central 
banks in setting monetary policy over the coming months. 
central banks could face a difficult combination of upside 
inflationary pressures and weaker economic activity. 
most central banks have been easing policy over the past year, 
with rate cuts expected to continue in 2025, but the scope for 
easing has narrowed. inflation uncertainty has risen, presenting 
central banks with a challenge similar to that posed by the 
supply shocks of 2021: determining whether the tariff-induced 
price increases will be transitory or persistent. typically, tariff 
hikes have short-lived effects. however, heightened uncertainty 
around tariff policies and the fact that many economies have 
not yet returned to the ‘low-inflation regimes’ that preceded the 
covid-19 pandemic could push inflation expectations higher.
global economic growth is expected to remain below pre-
covid-19 averages, while the trajectory of inflation has 
become less certain. risks to global growth have risen, with 
tariff increases and heightened uncertainty expected to lower 
it further. amid extreme levels of uncertainty, many central 
banks have held policy rates steady in recent months as they 
look to incoming data to better assess risks.
20 in february 2025, indonesia experienced a shift from inflation to 
deflation following massive discounts (50%) in electricity bills which 
were implemented to stimulate the economy. see reuters, ‘indonesia 
sees first deflation reading in more than two decades’, 3 march 2025.

box 3 does artificial intelligence imply 
 stronger growth?
global growth has averaged 3.3% over the past three years, which 
is below the 3.7% average of the 2010–19 period. medium-term 
growth forecasts by the international monetary fund (imf), a proxy 
for global potential growth, remain around the 3.0% level up to 2029, 
while the world bank sees potential growth averaging only 2.2% from 
2022 to 2030. 1, 2 in the absence of major productivity shocks, this 
modest performance may well become the new normal, with the world 
economy revisiting secular stagnation. 
secular stagnation was attributed to reduced capital accumulation 
rates following the global financial crisis and a slowdown in total factor 
productivity amid allocative inefficiencies, including weak growth in 
labour supply and lower participation rates.3
productivity differences explain the differences between national 
economies. for example, the united states (us) has shown exceptional 
productivity growth over time, reflecting robust within-sector gains 
driven by higher labour turnover and investment in digital technologies.4 
industry-level data shows strong gains in data processing, internet 
broadcasting and some sectors (such as e-commerce) that may 
have benefited from early artificial intelligence (ai) implementation. 5 
us productivity growth has, however, slowed in recent quarters, 
suggesting that part of these gains may have been cyclical.

3 the imf (op. cit.) estimated a 0.6 percentage point drag on total factor 
productivity growth from across-firm productivity, as labour and capital 
markets became less efficient at allocating resources to higher-productivity 
firms. the us appeared to be a notable exception.

recent analyses suggest that ai could substantially increase global 
potential growth by making production processes more efficient and 
accelerating innovation. however, the technology is still in its early 
stages, with the projected impacts of ai ranging from ‘moderate gains’ 
to ‘explosive growth’. 6, 7 in the meantime, uncertainty over the true 
long-term growth benefits of ai may trigger ‘boom-and-bust’ cycles in 
equity markets, similar to what other highly transformative technologies 
(railways, the internet) did in the past.8
what is clearer is that the growth benefits of ai will vary across countries 
depending on their ai preparedness and resources disparities. ai 
adoption is lagging in most emerging markets, partly due to a lack 
of capital and skills. 9 to bridge these gaps, emerging economies 
need to increase investment in research and development and digital 
infrastructure as well as boost education spending, particularly those 
leaning towards ai skills.10 policy efforts should also focus on lowering 
administrative obstacles and regulatory burdens.11 ai preparedness and 
adoption are among the priority areas for discussion this year in the 
group of twenty (g20), currently chaired by south africa.

global financial markets: 
tariffs upend markets
after relative calm in financial markets in the five months since 
october 2024, large shifts in global trade policy and increased 
risks of weaker global economic growth have upended 
markets. equities plunged at the start of april, as the fallout 
from the more-aggressive-than-expected us tariffs fuelled a 
flight to fixed-income instruments. the us dollar weakened as 
investors reduced positioning in us dollar assets, but risk-off 
sentiment also spread through to emerging market assets and 
currencies, resulting in abrupt depreciation and higher emerging 
market bond yields. south african government bond yields also 
increased, and the curve steepened, reflecting the unfavourable 
global and domestic news-flow. the rand weakened sharply 
to a one-year low at the start of april, reversing gains made in 
the first quarter of this year. amid elevated global and domestic 
uncertainty, local markets now see lower interest rates later this 
year, although it is likely that these expectations will exhibit high 
volatility for some time.
the future is not what it used to be
following a strong start to 2025, economic uncertainty has 
progressively weighed on consumer and corporate confidence 
as well as global growth prospects. technology stocks, 
the main beneficiary of investor sentiment in 2024, were 
increasingly perceived to be over-valued, while enthusiasm 
for other sectors remained relatively muted. with confidence 
weaker, a big market rout was triggered at the start of april 
after the us announced more-aggressive-than-anticipated 
tariff increases on all imports, followed by retaliatory measures 
by china. the s&p 500 index slumped by over 17% from its 
february peak as of the first week of april 2025. the stoxx 
europe 600 index fell by a similar magnitude from a record 
high in march – reached at a time when european union 
government leaders’ committed to increase spending on 
defence and infrastructure.
the stronger sentiment in january 2025 resulted in the 
10-year us government bond yield climbing to a high of 4.8% 
as markets scaled back anticipated interest rate cuts by the 
fed. elsewhere, uk gilt, german bund as well as peripheral 
bond yields all rose in the five months to march this year. the 
10-year germany bund yield increased by 70 basis points 
between october 2024 and march 2025, driven largely by 
higher public borrowing and expected economic growth, 
rather than higher inflation expectations. the sharp reversals 
in markets in april have changed expectations, with stronger 
inflation and much weaker economic growth seen as distinct 
possibilities. as a result, bond yields declined notably. 21
21 by early april 2025, the focus had shifted to downside economic 
growth risks, causing the yield on the 10-year us treasury note 
to drop by around 80 basis points relative to its january peak.

for the six months prior to the us tariff announcement, 
emerging market bonds had performed better than their 
advanced economy counterparts, reflected by higher total 
returns as well as 10 successive months (up until february) of 
non-resident net portfolio inflows. 22 the tariff announcement 
of 2 april triggered a broad sell-off of emerging market assets, 
but among them, idiosyncratic risks have generated further 
downturns. south african and turkish bonds have, in particular, 
underperformed relative to brazilian and mexican peers, partly 
reflecting domestic factors.
dollar weaker, gold stronger
the post-pandemic era saw the us economy outperform 
other advanced economies. china’s growth model came 
under increased strain, while india’s strengthened. higher 
debt levels and less growth weighed on other emerging 
economies. this pattern was broadly reflected in currencies. 
in more recent months, these trends have changed, in part 
reflecting the increased concerns about the sustainability of 
growth. after rising strongly against most currencies since 
october 2024, the us dollar reached a multi-year high in 
january 2025, before declining sharply into march. 23, 24 
most advanced economy and emerging market currencies 
strengthened against the greenback in the first quarter of 2025. 
however, the tariff turmoil has reignited currency depreciations 
for some emerging markets, reversing the earlier gains. 
advanced economy currencies such as the japanese yen, 
swiss franc and euro benefited from a flight to safety. even the 
canadian dollar, which had come under pressure over the past 
six months, managed to recoup some losses. 
one part of the rise in certain asset prices up to january 
this year reflected increasing concern about equity market 
valuations, in particular whether growth in technology 
companies was sustainable. this gave rise to stronger gold 
prices as some investors sought safe havens, backed up by 
increased purchases by central banks. the gold price rose 
to a record nominal high of over us$3 000 per fine ounce 
in early april. another trend emerged in speculative assets, 
with the price of bitcoin reaching a record high above 
us$107 000 in january as a more supportive stance in the 
us towards digital assets encouraged retail, speculative and 
institutional investors to increase their holdings. however, 
similar to the dollar, its price has since declined. 
22 according to the institute for international finance’s march 2025 
capital flows tracker report.
23 the intercontinental exchange dollar index (dxy) climbed to 
its highest level in 26 months, while the fed’s nominal dollar 
index reached a record high in late february 2025.
24 according to the commodity futures trading commission, speculative 
traders, including hedge funds and asset managers, were the least bullish 
on the us dollar since october 2024, before the us presidential elections.

despite shifts in confidence and elevated policy uncertainty, 
markets now anticipate more rate cuts this year, and more 
so for the us, than they did at the start of march, as the 
tariff increases are expected to slow growth while adding to 
inflationary pressures. however, rate expectations are likely to 
remain volatile as the medium-term implications for inflation 
and growth are hard to assess. the recent lowering of rate 
expectations suggests markets are more concerned about the 
trajectory of growth than inflation. 
south african financial 
market developments
local factors appear to have driven domestic market 
performance, at least during the first half of the review period. 
with south africa’s inflation and inflation expectations easing 
significantly, the spread between the 10-year us treasury 
and south african bond yield − often seen as an indicator of 
the risk premium of south african debt over ‘safe’ assets − 
narrowed to pre-pandemic levels by year-end. a stable political 
climate and the unwinding of election-related risks, along with 
s&p global ratings’ revision of the country’s rating outlook 
from stable to positive in november 2024, also supported the 
rally. however, the trend has reversed since the start of 2025 
due to less favourable domestic and global factors. in addition, 
tensions with the us may have added to perceived risk. 25
the domestic yield curve has ‘bear steepened’ since 
october 2024, making borrowing more expensive for long 
term borrowers, including the government. 26 this steepening 
became more pronounced into early april 2025, reflecting the 
global risk-off environment and uncertainties related to the 
steadiness of the existing coalition government. non-resident 
investors have supported the domestic bond market, with net 
purchases of about r18 billion in south african government 
bonds up to the end of march.
after brushing off global trade policy uncertainty to reach a 
record high in march 2025, the jse all-share index, similarly to 
most other global bourses, came under serious pressure at the 
start of april, and declined by over 10% from its peak. mining 
stocks have been a noteworthy outperformer since the release 
of the october 2024 mpr , mostly driven by gains in precious 
metals prices. however, equities have seen large foreign net 
outflows of r74 billion in the first quarter of this year, in part a 
reflection of a still muted domestic growth environment.
25 see, for instance, m gavin, ‘trump’s misguided policy towards south 
africa’, council on foreign relations blog, 12 february 2025.
26 a yield curve ‘bear steepens’ when longer-term yields rise more than 
short-term ones – increasing the spread, while it ‘bear flattens’ when 
short-term yields rise faster than long-term ones, resulting in a flatter 
 yield curve.

the rand was volatile over the six-month review period, driven 
by global and domestic factors. after benefiting from the us 
dollar weakness between january and march this year, the 
local currency depreciated sharply at the start of april amid 
heightened global economic uncertainty and unfavourable 
domestic news-flow. the rand has weakened by around 10% 
since october 2024, with a 4.0% depreciation for the year 
so far. 
domestic policy rate expectations implied in forward rate 
agreements have also shown volatility. after having been 
dialed back significantly to just one more rate cut this year, the 
dynamics have shifted more recently, with nearly two 25 basis 
point interest rate cuts anticipated in six months’ time.

real economy: will economic 
activity lift off this year?
the domestic economy expanded by 0.6% in 2024. the modest 
expansion was underpinned by steady growth in household 
spending, with support from government consumption and 
the foreign sector. investment detracted from total output 
last year. on the production side, activity was driven by the 
tertiary sector, while the primary and secondary sectors both 
contracted. the economy is forecast to expand by 1.7% this 
year, buoyed by continued growth in household demand, as 
consumers benefit from softer inflation, lower borrowing costs 
and two-pot retirement system withdrawals. with business 
confidence on the mend, some recovery in fixed investment 
is anticipated this year. looking further ahead, real gdp and 
potential growth are both projected to rise to 2.0% by the end 
of the forecast period, conditional on further improvements in 
the supply of electricity and logistical services.
recent economic developments
south africa’s annual growth rate stood at 0.6% in 2024, slightly 
down from 0.7% in 2023, highlighting the economy’s ongoing 
struggle to escape its low growth environment. despite a 
sustained improvement in electricity supply and some signs 
that logistical bottlenecks are beginning to ease, the recovery 
in economic activity has been sluggish. this mostly reflects the 
overhang from prolonged supply-side constraints.27 expansion 
in production has also been hampered by ongoing industry 
challenges, including muted global and domestic demand as 
well as a loss of competitiveness.
as in previous years, sectoral performance was mixed. 
economic growth was again led by the tertiary sector, despite 
the transport and trade sectors contracting. 28 the finance 
industry, which accounts for nearly a quarter of total gdp, 
was the main contributor to growth in the second half of 2024, 
expanding by 4.0%. the trade sector’s output was flat in the 
second half of the year, after contracting markedly in the first 
half of the year. 
27 see a khoza, k morema, m mofokeng and m tshenkeng, ‘will gdp 
firmly lift from supply-side improvements or is the economy scarred?’, 
 economic note no. en/2024/22 , 
pretoria: sarb, december 2024.
28 the sector grew by 1.2% year on year in the final six months of 
2024, contributing 0.9 percentage points to gdp growth.

the primary and secondary sectors both detracted from gdp 
growth in 2024, with the former subtracting the most.29, 30 modest 
field crop harvests following the 2023–24 mid-summer drought 
negatively affected agricultural performance in the second 
half of the year. meanwhile, total mining production remained 
weak despite improved electricity supply. south african gold 
miners were unable to fully capitalise on the record-high gold 
prices partly due to structural headwinds, including high energy 
and operating costs as well as lengthy permitting processes 
for exploration.31 a plethora of factors also continued to weigh 
on production in mining, manufacturing and other activities. 
output growth remained constrained by logistical challenges 
in ports and rail, muted demand and reduced competitiveness 
due to high input costs, skills shortages and low investment. 32
data from stats sa suggests that the labour market has 
recovered fully from the pandemic shock in 2020. however, 
employment growth in the past two years has been muted, 
in line with the sluggish output growth during this period. 
while t he quarterly labour force survey (qlfs) indicated 
some modest employment gains in the second half of 2024, 
the quarterly employment statistics (qes) data pointed to a 
contraction.33 this discrepancy may stem from differences in 
sampling approaches, with the qlfs sampling households, 
while the qes samples non-agricultural enterprises. however, 
when considering the sarb’s linked employment series – 
which is based on the stats sa qes data – the post-covid-19 
recovery in employment is more subdued – consistent with a 
broadly flat profile of real total employee compensation. 
household consumption increased by 1.8% in the final six 
months of 2024 compared to a year earlier. spending benefited 
from improving household real disposable income as inflation 
declined and interest rates were cut, with the expectations of 
29 the primary sector shrunk by 1.8% year on year in the second half 
of 2024, mostly driven by agriculture which contracted by 5.1%. 
growth in the mining sector was flat (0.1% year on year) during the 
last six months of 2024. on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the sector 
contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter, following an increase 
of 0.8% in the third quarter. see t liebenberg, ‘agrisa highlights 
positive developments in agricultural sector amid mixed fortunes in 
q3 2024’, media release, pretoria: agrisa, 3 december 2024.
30 all the secondary sub-sectors contracted in the fourth quarter of 2024, 
on a quarter-on-quarter basis. the manufacturing sector contracted by 
0.6% after a 0.3% expansion in the third quarter; the construction sector 
fell by 0.4% following an increase of 0.8% in the third quarter, while 
electricity contracted by 1.4% in the fourth quarter after growing 
by 1.3% in the third quarter.

drive unemployment down to 31.9% in the fourth quarter. in the qes , 
employment declined by 1.2% and 0.4% during the third and fourth

further rate cuts supporting consumer confidence. 34 the two-
pot retirement system withdrawals, which cumulated to roughly 
r35 billion by year-end, also played a key role in propelling 
household consumption in the final quarter of the year.
by contrast, investment spending disappointed, with capital 
expenditure by all organisations and all asset classes still below 
pre-pandemic levels. the second half of 2024 saw significant 
year-on-year declines of 3.2% in private investment and 5.1% 
in public corporation investment, while general government 
investment rose by 2.0%. for the full year, total investment 
contracted by 3.7%. this poor performance in investment was 
at odds with the generally more upbeat business sentiment. 
after surging in 2023, reduced spending on embedded 
electricity generation, as evidenced by capital goods import 
data, was likely among the proximate causes of the drop in 
private investment. at state-owned companies, insufficient 
market competition and balance sheet strain continued to 
weigh on investment. 
more broadly, muted demand growth and negative supply 
shocks continued to subdue investment appetite. faced 
with these constraints, it is unsurprising that the announced 
fixed investment projects in 2024 were mostly related to 
replacement capital (61.2%), which dwarfed expansionary 
investment (14%).35
growth outlook
growth over the medium term is anticipated to be driven 
by household spending, with support from investment. 
government spending is expected to be broadly neutral, 
while net exports are expected to detract from growth this 
year and remain largely neutral from 2026. further progress in 
reducing domestic supply-side constraints would enhance the 
contribution of these components to growth. 
a low inflation environment, continued withdrawals from 
the two-pot retirement system and declining debt-service 
costs are expected to improve household finances. lower 
borrowing costs and stronger household balance sheets 
should also improve credit demand and affordability, further 
boosting consumer confidence. the recovery in employment 
and earnings as real economic activity strengthens should 
further buoy consumer confidence and incomes. however, the 
proposed vat increases as well as further fiscal drag could 
dampen household spending growth. overall, real spending 
by households is projected to grow by 2.0% in 2025, 1.6% in 
2026 and 1.9% in 2027. 
34 real household net wealth has increased strongly over the past two years 
as growth in the value of financial assets, especially in pension funds 
and long-term insurers, outpaced that of liabilities.

investment spending is projected to increase by 2.1% this 
year, rising to 3.6% in the outer year of the forecast. capital 
spending is expected to benefit from the implementation of 
embedded-generation plans with a capacity of approximately 
8  700 megawatts (mw). 36 meanwhile, stronger consumption 
demand and improved business confidence should start 
to spur private investment beyond the energy space. public 
sector infrastructure investment could complement and 
potentially incentivise private sector capital formation, with 
national treasury allocating r1  trillion over the next three 
years. however, possible delays in project approval processes 
and underspending on public sector investment projects pose 
downside risks to the outlook for capital expenditure.
economic activity is expected to receive additional support 
from the foreign sector. over the forecast horizon, a slower 
deceleration in commodity export prices relative to those 
predicted in the october 2024 mpr is expected to improve the 
terms of trade and thus domestic demand.
although risks relating to electricity supply remain, as seen 
in the short bouts of load-shedding during the first quarter of 
this year, the sarb continues to assume that load-shedding 
will have no material impact on growth over the medium term. 
logistics reforms should also support the growth outlook, with 
government providing a roadmap for private train operator 
companies to access the rail network. 37 
overall, the sarb forecasts real and potential gdp to 
expand by 1.7% and 1.4% respectively this year, reaching 
2.0% in 2027. these growth projections remain sensitive to 
the full implementation of the ongoing structural reforms in 
the energy and logistics sectors as well as the evolution of 
the global economy. tariffs and trade restrictions present 
a serious threat to global economic activity, with spillovers 
to south africa.
36 a total capacity of 2 707 mw (1 088 mw photovoltaic, 1 601 mw 
wind and 18 mw biogas) is expected to reach commercial operation in 
2026, rising to a cumulative 8 681 mw by 2027. see eskom, medium-

macro balances
the current account and its drivers
the current account deficit narrowed markedly to -0.6% of gdp 
in 2024 from -1.6% in 2023. this improvement can primarily 
be attributed to a rising trade surplus. net exports benefited 
from higher agricultural and manufacturing exports, while 
imports softened due to weak investment demand and lower 
oil prices.38 the services, income and transfer account deficit 
remained relatively unchanged over the review period. however, 
the current account is still forecast to deteriorate over the 
medium term as commodity export prices normalise towards 
pre-covid-19 levels, while the recovery in domestic investment 
is expected to stimulate imports. the current account deficit 
is forecast to average 1.2% (compared to 2.2% in the october 
mpr) this year, widening to 2.2% by 2027.
fiscal balances
the medium-term fiscal framework presented in the 
2025 budget showed a slight deterioration in the fiscal position 
compared with last year’s budget. the ratio of debt to gdp 
is now expected to peak 0.9 percentage points higher at 
76.2% this fiscal year, driven by a wider main budget deficit. 
however, the disappointing gdp growth outturn in the fourth 
quarter of 2024 raises the risk of debt levels rising even higher. 
this deterioration is partly due to total expenditure, which is 
projected to increase by roughly r160 billion over the medium 
term compared with previous projections, while revenue 
− buoyed by new tax measures − rises by r100  billion. 39 
accordingly, the trajectory of the primary surplus is 
moderately lower relative to the 2024 budget. the 2025 budget 
continues to target a rising primary surplus as the key metric 
to stabilise debt.
south africa’s debt is high and is becoming increasingly 
costly for the economy as it exerts upward pressure on 
the risk premium and the exchange rate. real long-term 
government bond yields remain high and debt-service costs 
consume nearly a quarter of total revenue – resources that 
could be deployed to support investment and growth as well 
as enhance the resilience of the domestic economy. on the 
whole, the fiscal position is subject to risks, including possible 
support to state-owned enterprises with fragile balance sheets 
and lower-than-expected growth. 
38 total agricultural and manufacturing exports increased by 2.7% and 
3.3% respectively in 2024, while total imports declined by 4.0%.
39 the budget proposed a phased-in 1 percentage point vat hike, along 
with fiscal drag (no inflationary adjustment to income tax brackets).

conclusion 
despite slowing over the past two years, stronger domestic 
growth is expected this year and over the forecast horizon. 
the reuters median growth forecast predicts a 1.7% increase 
in 2025, in line with the sarb’s latest forecast, with growth 
expected to reach 2.0% by 2027. however, these growth 
rates still remain below long-run growth estimates of 2.5%. 
broadening the scope of reforms beyond energy and logistics, 
including stabilising public debt and lowering the risk premium, 
is key to further unlocking the economy’s productive potential, 
bringing it closer to the level of other emerging economies at 
around 4.0%.

5 producer deliveries declined by 55% in the second quarter of 2022 before 
jumping to 38.4% in the third quarter.
despite its small share (2.5%) in gross domestic product (gdp), 
agriculture has had a disproportionately large impact on total gdp 
growth in recent years. the rising volatility of quarterly agricultural 
gross value added (gva) over the past few years has contributed to 
the increased unpredictability of overall gdp and largely explains gdp 
growth forecast errors.
the total output of the agricultural sector is made up of activity from its 
three core subsectors, namely field crops, horticulture and livestock. 
the field crops subsector (28% of gross income) is the most volatile, 
partly reflecting the increasingly changing and unpredictable weather 
conditions. horticulture (28%) and livestock (44%) exhibit significantly 
less volatility. 
the increased volatility in agricultural output has various sources. cycles 
of droughts and floods have impacted crop yields and led to the death 
or slaughter of livestock. 1 severe load-shedding in 2022 and 2023 
disrupted farming processes and caused significant losses across all 
subsectors.2, 3 volatility in agricultural gva has also reflected shifts in 
the timing of planting and harvests as well as potential measurement 
challenges.4 for example, in 2022, the maize crop was harvested later 
than usual due to heavy rains, which shifted a large share of deliveries 
to the third quarter.5 by contrast, the drought of 2024 led to an earlier-
than-usual maize harvest, with the bulk of deliveries taking place in the 
second quarter.
the volatility of agricultural output affects gdp growth forecasts and 
subsequently impacts output gap estimates. to minimise distortions to 
output gap estimates caused by supply-side volatility in gdp growth, 
the frequently adjusts its potential gdp 
growth estimates.

box 5 agriculture and inventories drive 2024 growth forecast misses
1 forecasts are accurate if predictions are close to actual outcomes and unbiased if there is no tendency to over- or underestimate actual outcomes.
2 the standard deviation of quarter-on-quarter growth increased to 0.85 in 2022–24 compared with 0.57 in 2017–19. it is important to note that the 
post-covid-19 period in this case excludes 2021 as the rebound from the low levels of 2020 could skew the results. 
3 see bureau for food and agricultural policy (bfap), perspectives on agriculture performance in q3 of 2024, pretoria: bfap , december 2024.
4 the sarb projected agriculture to increase by 27.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, but it grew by 17.2%.
5 the sarb’s one-quarter-ahead root mean square error (rmse) is 0.5, marginally higher than the reuters median rmse of 0.4. excluding agriculture, the 
sarb’s rmse improves to 0.3.
6 ‘other’ includes the electricity, construction, trade and community services sectors.
7 both the sarb and private analysts (reuters median) overestimated 2024 gdp growth at every mpc meeting. the sarb’s average forecast error – a 
measure of forecast bias – was 0.68 (compared to 0.85 for the reuters median). similarly, other institutions’ 2024 growth forecasts for south africa were 
also biased on the upside, with average forecast errors of 0.49 for the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd); 0.73 for the 
international monetary fund (imf); and 0.94 for the world bank.
8 the change in inventories detracted a full percentage point from overall growth in 2024.
gross domestic product (gdp) growth forecasts, along with those of potential growth, help determine the degree of slack in the economy. 
accurate and unbiased growth forecasts support better monetary policy decision-making, all other things being equal.1 this box assesses the 
accuracy of the ’s (sarb) growth predictions for 2024.
the sarb overestimated gdp growth in 2024. the first in-year forecast in january 2024 had the sarb projecting growth of 1.2% for the year, 
against the actual outturn of 0.6%. much of the difficulty in forecasting gdp reflects increased volatility in key components and the prevalence 
of large supply shocks.2 on the production side, the volatile agricultural sector was the largest contributor to last year’s forecast error. in the 
third quarter of 2024, agricultural production contracted by 28.8%, well beyond expectations. subsequent forecast revisions also proved overly 
optimistic as data revisions by statistics south africa reduced the size of the initial quarterly outcome, but not by as much as expected.3, 4
excluding agriculture from gdp improves the sarb’s forecast errors significantly, although transport, storage and communication as well as the 
grouping ‘other’ were also consistently overestimated.5, 6 by contrast, finance, real estate and business services tended to be underestimated. 
part of the challenge in forecasting these sectors is the absence of relevant high-frequency data. the forecasting difficulty extends to the entire 
economics community, as seen in the reuters median, which shows similarly large gdp forecast errors for 2024.7
on the expenditure side, private investment and the change in inventories were overestimated. following strong growth of 6.0% and 3.0% 
in 2022 and 2023 respectively, private investment was forecast to expand by 2.9% last year, underpinned by spending on renewable energy 
projects. however, private investment contracted by 4.1%. inventories experienced unexpected drawdowns in all four quarters.8 conversely, 
net exports were underestimated mainly due to lower-than-expected imports, in line with overall domestic growth and investment forecast 
errors. this slightly offset some of the overestimated components and improved the overall forecast accuracy.

in conclusion, heightened volatility in agricultural output caused unpredictable swings in realised gdp and explains much of the forecast errors 
and bias. as hard data either comes with significant lags or is not available, errors can also stem from the use of near-term projections and 
wide-ranging nowcast estimates to determine starting points for forecasts. the monetary policy committee’s use of scenarios and other inputs 
help to moderate the influence of challenging forecasting on policy decisions.

price developments: inflation 
in target, but will it stick?
headline inflation softened markedly in the second half of 
2024, falling to 2.8% in october before edging higher to 3.2% 
in february this year. the rapid deceleration stemmed from 
sharply lower food and fuel inflation that benefited from rand 
appreciation and falling oil prices, along with base effects. a 
stronger rand, together with monetary policy choices, declining 
inflation expectations and subdued ulc pressures, exerted 
downside influence on core prices, further pulling headline 
inflation lower. some of these disinflationary tailwinds have 
since weakened or reversed, while new risks have emerged. 
the sarb expects headline inflation to slow to 3.6% this year 
from 4.4% in 2024 before stabilising at the target midpoint from 
2026. however, confidence around the medium-term outlook 
has reduced significantly due to heightened global trade 
tensions and elevated domestic uncertainties. 
oil prices and fuel inflation
lower oil prices and a stronger rand were key drivers of 
headline disinflation in the second half of 2024. the brent 
crude oil price eased to us$80 per barrel in 2024, down from 
us$83 per barrel in the previous year. the rand exchange 
rate also strengthened appreciably in the second half of 
2024. these dynamics contributed to fuel deflation of 0.8% 
in 2024. however, the start of 2025 brought some volatility to 
oil prices, with a 7.6% month-on-month brent crude oil price 
surge in january followed by a 4.8% decline in february. 40
looking ahead, brent crude oil prices are projected to benefit 
from the expected sustained oversupply of around one million 
barrels per day into the medium term, reflecting expectations 
of weaker global demand and rising production by opec+ 
members (members of the organization of the petroleum 
exporting countries (opec) plus other oil-producing 
countries).41 accordingly, the sarb has lowered its medium-
term crude oil price assumption from us$81 per barrel in the 
october 2024 mpr to an average of us$76 per barrel.
administered price inflation
as a result of falling fuel prices, administered price inflation has 
slowed sharply in recent months, moderating from an average 
of 8.1% in the first half of the year to just 2.6% in the second 
half. administered price inflation averaged 1.8% over the five 
months to february 2025. when excluding the basic fuel 
price, which is determined by movements in international oil 
40 the january 2025 increase in brent crude oil prices was spurred by 
fears of tighter sanctions on russia and iran and colder-than-expected 
weather conditions in north america. concerns surrounding trade 
tensions and more subdued global growth, and their impacts on oil 
demand, returned in february, however, causing oil prices to recede.

prices and the rand exchange rate, administered price inflation 
remained exceedingly high at 7.5% in 2024. 42 inflation for this 
component is, however, projected to ease to 5.1% by 2027.
unlike the cyclical nature of fuel prices, electricity price inflation 
has continued to exert steady upside pressure on administered 
prices. since 2009, electricity prices have risen more than five-
fold, while other administered prices excluding electricity have 
roughly tripled. over the past year, electricity prices climbed by 
13.3%, while average price increases in the economy (inflation) 
rose by just 4.4%. another large electricity price increase is 
projected for this year.43 domestic electricity prices have both 
the scope and tendency to increase above the inflation rate, 
reflecting the need to entice more investment in the sector 
and the nature of the regulatory framework, which includes 
provisions for cost recovery on diesel usage. 44 the sarb 
expects electricity inflation to average 11.8% this year, easing 
to 6.6% by 2027, but risks are tilted to the upside considering 
possible clawbacks related to diesel usage to avert load-
shedding.
inflation for the other components of administered prices, 
such as water and assessment rates, remained elevated 
in 2024, averaging 8.5% and 7.1% respectively. historical 
underinvestment in water infrastructure and broader concerns 
about municipal financial viability have continued to hinder service 
provisioning while raising costs, contributing to expectations 
that inflation in these components will remain elevated.
large administered price increases not only affect consumer 
inflation but also raise the cost structure of the economy as 
most administered components serve as factors of production. 
administered price increases are therefore often passed on 
to consumers. importantly, while administered price inflation 
exerts upside pressure on headline inflation, muted headline 
inflation simultaneously acts to depress administered price 
inflation.45 administered price inflation can be reduced through 
regulatory interventions to ensure price increases are cost-
reflective as well as indirectly by achieving a low and stable 
headline inflation on a sustained basis. 46
42 administered components of the fuel price include fuel 
taxes, the road accident fund levy and margins.
43 the national energy regulator of south africa (nersa) 
recently approved a 12.74% electricity tariff increase for 
the 2025/26 financial year, effective from april 2025, and 
increases of 5.36% in 2026/27 and 6.19% in 2027/28.

food and non-alcoholic 
beverages inflation
food and non-alcoholic beverages (nab) inflation fell 
significantly in 2024, averaging 4.5% for the year, down from 
10.7% in the previous year. this 6.2 percentage point decline 
is the largest year-to-year slowdown since 2010. as was 
characteristic of non-core components in the second half 
of 2024, food and nab price dynamics benefited from rand 
strength. the containment of domestic idiosyncratic shocks 
such as foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza and load-
shedding, along with base effects and deflationary global 
agricultural commodity prices, also helped spur a more rapid 
and broad-based disinflation. 
the meat as well as the milk, other dairy products and eggs 
components contributed the most to the deceleration in 
food and nab inflation, with both components experiencing 
base effect-driven easing as the impacts of avian influenza 
worked out of the year-on-year numbers. cereal products 
inflation also eased notably, troughing at 3.7% in november 
2024 before ticking up modestly. the turn likely reflected the 
pass-through of higher maize prices induced by the 2023−24 
el niño-related drought. 
looking ahead, the sarb expects higher inflation for meat 
and cereal products in 2025, at 2.6% and 5.2% respectively. 
rising meat inflation is due to fading base effects and the 
expected recovery in the demand for red meat. meanwhile, 
higher white maize spot prices will likely continue to exert 
upside pressures on cereal products for the remainder of 
the first half of 2025. however, the return of la niña weather 
conditions should support a moderation in price increases in 
the second half of this year.
despite some upside pressures from the large-weight 
components (meat and cereals), along with rising global 
agricultural commodity prices, the sarb expects overall food 
and nab inflation to remain contained at 3.8% this year, rising 
to the target midpoint from 2026. risks to this forecast include 
exchange rate movements and the pass-through effect of vat 
increases.

core inflation 
after remaining relatively elevated in the first half of 2024 when 
it averaged 4.7%, core inflation softened in the second half 
of the year, averaging 4.0%. for the full year, core inflation 
averaged 4.3%, down from 4.8% the year before. average 
annual inflation was dragged lower by a sharp deceleration in 
core goods inflation.
measures of underlying inflation tracked by the sarb, 
namely core, trimmed mean, supercore and the persistent 
and common component of inflation (pcci), have shown 
substantial cooling in price pressures. 47 the fading second-
round effects of past shocks, coupled with better balance 
between demand and supply in the economy − supported 
by previous interest rate increases − have been key drivers 
in dampening underlying inflationary pressures. 48 looking 
ahead, core inflation is expected to remain subdued at 3.7% 
this year, rising to the target midpoint over the outer years of 
the forecast period.
after peaking at 6.6% in august 2023, core goods inflation 
moderated to reach a low of 2.2% in both january and 
february 2025. disinflation in this component was spurred 
by a stronger rand and base effects. vehicles, along with 
several smaller-weight components of the core goods basket, 
contributed the most to disinflation. however, the announced 
vat increases and global trade tensions present upside risks. 
the sarb projects core goods inflation to average 3.2% this 
year and rise to 4.6% by 2027.
47 over the review period, core inflation averaged 3.6%, trimmed 
mean inflation 3.6%, supercore inflation 3.5% and pcci 4.5%.

services components, such as education, also recorded 
above-target inflation increases. in contrast, housing 
continued to provide downward impetus, having remained 
below its long-term average since the pandemic. 49
services inflation eased significantly over the past six 
months, declining from 4.4% in october 2024 to a low of 
3.8% in february 2025. the moderation was broad-based. at 
a macro level, services disinflation benefited from moderating 
inflation expectations, subdued wage increases and muted 
ulc growth. these forces are expected to continue exerting 
disinflationary pressures over the near term, contributing to a 
target undershoot in services inflation before it rises towards 
the target midpoint in the outer years of the forecast period. 
vat increases and administered prices, however, pose upside 
risks to this forecast.

medium-term inflation outlook
over the medium term, the trajectory of core inflation, and 
by extension headline inflation, is explained by four factors, 
namely inflation expectations, the output gap, ulcs and the 
exchange rate gap.
inflation expectations capture the views of economic agents 
about the evolution of prices in the economy. when agents 
act based on these views, inflation expectations can influence 
inflation. the bureau for economic research’s (ber) policy-
relevant two-year-ahead inflation expectations have eased 
closer to the midpoint of the target band with signs of re-
anchoring.50 given the backward-looking nature of surveyed 
inflation expectations, further moderation is expected in the 
coming quarters. inflation expectations are expected to hover 
around the target midpoint over the forecast period.
the output gap, which measures the extent of demand 
pressures on inflation, is expected to be modestly negative 
in the near term but to close over the medium term, implying 
broadly neutral inflationary pressures. 51 in the absence of 
other sources of inflationary or disinflationary pressures, 
a closed output gap is consistent with inflation around the 
target midpoint. 
inflationary pressures from the labour market surprised to 
the downside this past year as expectations of backward 
indexation failed to materialise. in the qpm, labour market 
inflationary pressures stem from the real ulc gap and nominal 
ulc growth. the former captures whether the real wage per 
worker, per unit of output, deviates from its productivity-
aligned (equilibrium) level, while the latter is the nominal 
labour cost growth of producing a unit of output. given 
expectations for stronger gdp growth, productivity growth 
is forecast to exceed real wages growth over the medium 
term, while nominal ulc growth is projected to average 3.5% 
over the medium term. 52 together, these dynamics suggest 
reduced labour market pressures on headline inflation over 
the forecast horizon.
50 two-year-ahead inflation expectations reached 4.6% in the fourth 
quarter of 2024 before ticking up slightly to 4.7% in the first quarter 
of 2025. measures of ‘anchoring’ tracked by the sarb, such as the 
dispersion of expectations of the respondents or the sensitivity of inflation 
expectations to past inflation, continued to improve throughout 2024.
51 the output gap is projected at -0.2% this year, -0.1% in 2026 and 0.0% 
in 2027.
52 nominal ulc growth is forecast at 3.2% this year, rising to 3.7% in both 
2026 and 2027.

april 2025
the rand exchange rate influences medium-term inflation 
through its impact on imported inflation and the real marginal 
cost of firms. the rand proved to be volatile over the review 
period. the starting point for the rand to the us dollar was 
r17.73 at the november 2024 mpc meeting but depreciated 
to r18.50 by the march 2025 mpc meeting. meanwhile, the 
real effective exchange rate was estimated to have been 
undervalued since the end of 2022. although the real 
exchange rate gap has narrowed, implying less inflationary 
pressures, the exchange rate is still expected to remain 
undervalued throughout the forecast period.
conclusion
headline inflation moderated strongly during the second half 
of 2024, benefiting from favourable oil price developments, a 
stronger rand and easing core price pressures. monetary policy 
has played a role, helping keep demand and supply in better 
balance. as these forces dissipate or reverse and the impacts 
of higher vat begin to transmit, inflation is expected to rise. the 
sarb expects headline inflation to remain contained this year, 
averaging 3.6%, before converging to the target midpoint over 
the outer years of the forecast period. the inflation projection 
is, however, subject to unusually high forecast uncertainty due 
to the difficult-to-quantify impacts of the vat increases and 
exceptionally high global economic uncertainty.
box 6 what is the pass-through risk? 
1 see f caselli and a roitman, ‘non-linear exchange rate pass- 
through in emerging markets’, international monetary fund working 
paper no. wp/16/1, washington dc: imf, january 2016.
2 see e choudri and d hakura, ‘exchange rate pass-through to 
domestic prices: does the inflationary environment matter?’, j ournal 
of international money and finance 25(4), 2006, pp 614–639.

changed in south africa?’, working 
paper no. wp/2016/10, pretoria: sarb, november 2016.
heightened global uncertainty and geopolitical tensions can cause 
large swings in exchange rates. depreciating currencies tend 
to generate rising prices, but the extent of this depends on how 
much of the exchange rate change gets passed into the rand 
prices of goods and services – termed the degree of exchange rate 
pass-through.
the degree of exchange rate pass-through varies over time and 
across different states of the economy. severe and sustained 
currency depreciations are typically associated with greater 
exchange rate pass-through, especially in emerging economies. 1
large depreciations squeeze profit margins by directly increasing 
the costs of imported goods (conversion effect) and indirectly by 
raising firm’s marginal costs. similarly, pass-through tends to be 
stronger during high inflation periods or economic upturns when 
firms have greater pricing power and demand is generally robust. 2,3
high and rising price increases allow firms to pass through more 
cost increases to consumers with little fear of losing market share. 
global uncertainty as well as the elasticity of firms’ costs with 
respect to output have also been found to affect the pass-through

rate.4 by contrast, stable inflation expectations (indicating more 
credible monetary policy) are, other things being equal, associated 
with lower exchange rate pass-through. 5
south africa’s exchange rate pass-through rate was at historical 
lows from 2017 to 2021. this coincided with a period of stable 
inflation around the target midpoint, a virtually closed output gap, 
and moderating and relatively stable inflation expectations. the 
macroeconomy, however, shifted markedly in 2022–23, with both 
inflation and inflation expectations rising strongly. as a result, pass-
through also rose.
although domestic inflation has eased markedly, with recent outcomes 
in the lower half of the 3-6% target band, and underlying inflation and 
inflation expectations around the target midpoint of 4.5%, inflation 
expectations have yet to fully re-anchor.6 in addition, the pass-through 
coefficient is still elevated as not enough time has passed since the return 
to the low-inflation regime. similarly, global economic uncertainty is at 
highs last seen during the covid-19 pandemic. therefore, on balance, 
the risk associated with exchange rate pass-through remains high.

one-year-ahead and two-year-ahead horizons respectively, while 
analysts’ rmses were 0.6, 0.4 and 0.1 respectively. average

forecasters, being 0.39, 0.33, 0.32 and 0.41 for the sarb, reuters 
median, the international monetary fund (imf) and the organisation 
for economic co-operation and development (oecd) respectively.
forecast error analysis allows the 
(sarb) to evaluate the accuracy of its model predictions and 
identify the necessary improvements to its forecasting framework 
to enhance efficacy and robustness. this box unpacks the inflation 
forecast errors of 2024.
while headline inflation averaged 4.4% in 2024, the sarb’s 
forecasts had anticipated higher rates for much of the year. analysts’ 
forecasts showed similar discrepancies to those of the sarb, with 
comparable root mean squared errors (rmses). 1
forecast errors worsened through much of the first half of 2024 
and improved towards the end of the year. typically, forecasts 
improve progressively as more information becomes available and is 
incorporated into the model. a breakdown for 2024 shows that the 
errors mostly stemmed from components linked to the exchange 
rate, which depreciated less than expected. the rand was forecast

to weaken in response to heightened financial market volatility 
following unusually uncertain elections around the world. however, 
the rand showed a secular appreciation for other reasons, including 
domestic policy settings, resulting in lower inflation in exchange 
rate-sensitive goods, in particular core goods and fuel, and to a 
lesser extent, food. oil prices also increased less than expected. 
similarly, unit labour costs came out lower than projected, and this, 
coupled with output gap estimates that were slightly more negative 
than initially expected, led to less pressure on services and food 
inflation than the forecasts had anticipated.
in addition to starting points and assumptions, monetary policy 
also impacts on forecast errors, in particular as policy is not fully 
reflected in near-term shifts in the forecast. if, for instance, interest 
rates are higher than implied by the sarb’s quarterly projection 
model (qpm), better-than-expected outcomes may occur in the 
various drivers of inflation. therefore, the pleasant surprise in the 
lower inflation outcome could, in part, be attributed to effective 
monetary policy.

conclusion
the world economy is experiencing extraordinarily high 
uncertainty. economic fault lines, stemming from policy 
shifts and heightened trade tensions, have emerged, 
adding to pre-existing geopolitical tensions. these shocks 
present new risks to both growth and inflation, and have 
rendered the global economic outlook more difficult to 
predict. us economic data, particularly consumer and 
business sentiment as well as stocks, has softened 
unexpectedly and the us dollar has weakened, while 
inflation remains relatively stubborn. meanwhile, stimulus 
measures in germany and china could see growth 
strengthen in these economies, narrowing the growth 
divergence of the past year among the world’s largest 
economies. 
global headline inflation is expected to moderate further 
this year and the next, but confidence is now lower. core 
inflation in advanced economies remains above targets, 
while inflation has been elevated in some emerging 
economies owing to strong demand, fiscal concerns 
and currency weakness. the combination of persistent 
services inflation and potential tariff-induced price 
increases presents material upside risks to global inflation.
central banks are expected to remain cautious due to 
increased inflation risks and the potential rise in neutral 
interest rates. modest further cuts by major central banks 
are, however, still projected for this year, but policy rates 
will likely remain higher for longer. with global interest 
rates high and risks elevated, the possibility for further 
rate cuts in emerging economies is limited as interest rate 
differentials narrow.
inflation in south africa is currently contained, and the 
outlook appears moderate and in line with the 4.5% target 
midpoint. however, the uncertainty around this outlook has 
risen markedly since the beginning of the year due to global 
and domestic risks, particularly heightened geopolitical 
and trade tensions as well as the proposed vat increases. 
the vat impacts are difficult to quantify in advance as 
they depend on an unknown pass-through rate and are 
staggered, which raises the risk of second-round effects.
the mpc lowered the policy rate by 50 basis points over 
the six-month period from october 2024 to march 2025, 
bringing it closer to its estimated neutral level. the qpm 
suggests one more 25 basis point rate cut in the second 
quarter of this year. financial markets and economic 
analysts broadly agree with this assessment, although rate 
expectations in forward rate agreements have exhibited 
some volatility. however, with risks and uncertainty 
unusually high, policy calibration will likely remain data-
dependent, while also underpinned by scenario analysis.
the south african economy recorded disappointing 
growth over the past two years, mostly reflecting serious 
bottlenecks in the energy and logistical sectors. while 
notable progress has been achieved in stabilising these 
sectors, they may continue to drag on economic activity 
for some time. these hysteresis effects are exacerbated 
by competitiveness factors, including elevated long-term 
borrowing costs as well as high costs of production skills, 
gaps and red tape, the materiality impact of which is 
becoming increasingly evident.
to ensure growth is more robust and resilient to shocks, 
domestic investment needs to rise significantly to rebalance 
the economy and complement household consumption 
spending. investment and output growth can be boosted 
further by adopting policy measures that permanently 
lower inflation risk and strengthen competitiveness.

glossary
advanced economies: advanced economies are countries 
with high gross domestic product (gdp) per capita, 
diversified exports and close integration into the global 
financial system. 
balance of payments : this is a record of transactions 
between the home country and the rest of the world over a 
specific period of time. it includes the current and financial 
accounts. see also ‘current account’ below.
brent crude: brent crude is a light and sweet blend of oil from 
five different fields in the north sea. the price of brent crude 
is one of the benchmark oil prices in international markets.
budget deficit: a budget deficit indicates the extent to which 
government expenditure exceeds government revenue.
business and consumer confidence : these are economic 
indicators that measure the level of optimism about 
the economy and its prospects among business managers 
and consumers.
commodities: commodities can refer to energy, agriculture, 
metals and minerals. major south african-produced 
commodities include platinum and gold.
consumer price index (cpi): the cpi provides an indication 
of aggregate price changes in the domestic economy. 
the index is calculated using a number of categories 
forming a representative set of goods and services bought 
by consumers.
core inflation : core generally refers to underlying 
inflation, excluding the volatile elements (e.g. food 
and energy prices). the sarb’s forecasts and 
discussions refer to headline cpi excluding food, 
non-alcoholic beverages (nab), fuel and electricity prices.
crude oil price : this is the united states (us) dollar price 
per barrel of unrefined oil. see also ‘brent crude’ above.
current account : the current account of the balance of 
payments consists of net exports (exports less imports) 
in the trade account as well as the services, income and 
current transfers.
emerging markets : emerging markets are countries with 
low to middle income per capita. they are advancing 
rapidly and are integrating with global (product and 
capital) markets.
exchange rate depreciation (appreciation ): exchange rate 
depreciation (appreciation) refers to a decrease (increase) in 
the value of a currency relative to another currency.
exchange rate pass-through: this is the effect of exchange 
rate changes on domestic inflation (i.e. the percentage 
change in domestic cpi due to a change in the exchange 
rate). changes in the exchange rate affect import prices, 
which in turn affect domestic consumer prices and inflation.
forecast horizon: this is the future period over which the 
sarb generates its forecasts, typically between two and 
three years.
gross domestic product (gdp) : gdp is the total market 
value of all the goods and services produced in a country. it 
includes total consumption expenditure, capital formation, 
government consumption expenditure and the value of 
exports less the value of imports.
gross fixed capital formation (investment) : the value of 
acquisitions of capital goods (e.g. machinery, equipment 
and buildings) by firms, adjusted for disposals, constitutes 
gross fixed capital formation.
headline consumer price index (cpi) : headline cpi refers 
to cpi for all urban areas, as measured on a monthly basis 
by statistics south africa (stats sa). headline cpi is a 
measure of price levels in all urban areas. the 12-month 
percentage change in headline cpi is referred to as ‘headline 
cpi inflation’ and reflects changes in the cost of living. this 
is the official inflation measure for south africa.
household consumption : this is the amount of money 
spent by households on consumer goods and services.
inflation (growth) outlook: this outlook refers to the evolution 
of future inflation (growth) over the forecast horizon.
inflation targeting : this is a monetary policy framework 
used by central banks to steer actual inflation towards an 
inflation target level or range.
monetary policy normalisation: this refers to the unwinding 
of an unusually accommodative monetary policy. it could 
also mean adjusting the economy’s policy rate towards its 
real neutral policy rate.
neutral real interest rate (nrir) : the nrir is the level at 
which the real interest rate will settle once the output gap is 
closed and inflation is stable. 
nominal effective exchange rate (neer) : the neer 
is an index that expresses the value of a country’s 
currency relative to a basket of other (trading-partner) 
currencies. an increase (decrease) in the neer indicates 
a strengthening (weakening) of the domestic currency with 
respect to the selected basket of currencies. the weighted 
average exchange rate of the rand is calculated against 
20 currencies. the weights of the five major currencies are 
as follows: the euro ( 30.68%), the chinese yuan (24.53%), 
the us dollar (10.56%), the japanese yen (4.95%) and the 
indian rupee (4.85%). index: 2015 = 100. see also ‘real 
effective exchange rate’ below. 
output gap/potential growth : potential growth is the 
rate of gdp growth that could theoretically be achieved if 
all the productive assets in the economy were employed 
in a stable inflation environment. the output gap is the 
difference between actual growth and potential growth, 
which accumulates over time. if this is negative, then the 
economy is viewed to be underperforming and demand 
40
april 2025
pressures on inflation are low. if the output gap is positive, the 
economy is viewed to be overheating and demand pressures 
are inflationary.
policy rate: a policy rate is the interest rate used by a central 
bank to implement monetary policy.
productivity: productivity indicates the amount of goods and 
services produced in relation to the resources utilised in the 
form of labour and capital.
real effective exchange rate (reer) : the reer is the neer 
adjusted for inflation differentials between south africa and its 
main trading partners. see also ‘nominal effective exchange 
rate’ above.
repurchase (repo) rate : this is the policy rate that is set 
by the monetary policy committee (mpc). it is the rate that 
commercial banks pay to borrow money from the sarb.
real repo rate : this is the nominal repo rate, as set by the 
mpc, adjusted for expected inflation.
terms of trade : this refers to the ratio of export prices to 
import prices.
unit labour cost (ulc) : a ulc is the labour cost to produce 
one ‘unit’ of output. this is calculated as the total wages 
and salaries in the non-agricultural sector divided by the real 
value added at basic prices in the non-agricultural sector of 
the economy.
