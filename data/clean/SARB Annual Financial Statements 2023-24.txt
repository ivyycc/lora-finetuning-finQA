annual financial statements 2023/24
introduction
the directors are pleased to present to stakeholders this report 
on the activities and financial results of the sarb, including its 
subsidiaries and associate (group), for the year under review.
the annual report, issued in terms of the sarb act and its 
regulations, addresses the performance of the group and its 
compliance with the relevant statutory information requirements.
it is the responsibility of the directors to prepare the group 
annual financial statements (financial statements) and related 
financial information that present the group’s state of affairs. 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the sarb act and the accounting policies set out in note 1. 
the financial statements include appropriate and responsible 
disclosures and are based on accounting policies that have 
been consistently applied, except as specified in note 1, and 
which are supported by reasonable judgements and estimates.
these financial statements were prepared on a going concern 
basis, taking cognisance of certain unique aspects relating to 
the sarb’s ability to create, distribute and destroy domestic 
currency; its role as ‘lender of last resort’ and resolution 
authority; its responsibilities in the areas of price and financial 
stability; and its relationship with the sa government concerning 
fx and gold transactions.
the directors have considered the impact of the volatility in 
financial markets, mainly as a result of interest rate hikes by 
central banks globally in an attempt to curb the steep rise in 
inflation, among other factors. the directors have also 
considered the impact of the ongoing russia-ukraine and 
israeli-palestinian conflicts. although the group has no direct 
exposure to these countries, the conflicts continue to negatively 
impact financial markets in general. the directors have 
concluded that the impact of the volatility in financial markets 
has had no effect on the going concern of the sarb and its 
subsidiaries. the directors have considered the impact of the 
current energy crisis and the prospect of extended periods of 
load-shedding on key financial sector infrastructures and sarb 
operations. the directors note that the sarb will continue to 
take the necessary actions to minimise the impact of load-
shedding on key financial sector infrastructures, sarb 
operations and its currency-producing subsidiaries. however, 
these matters will be monitored and included in considerations 
for forward-looking information.
the financial statements were audited by the independent 
external auditors who were given unrestricted access to all 
financial records and related data, including the minutes of all 
the meetings of the board and its committees as well as the 
minutes of executive management meetings.
the directors are responsible for governance, which is 
monitored on an ongoing basis. the sarb applies the 
principles and guidelines of king iv™ where appropriate and 
where they do not contravene the sarb act.
nature of business
the sarb is the central bank of south africa and is regulated 
in terms of the sarb act. its primary objective is to protect the 
value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainable 
economic growth. in pursuit of price and financial stability, the 
.
in exceptional circumstances, as part of its central banking 
functions, the sarb may act as a ‘lender of last resort’ or 
provide assistance of a similar nature to financial institutions in 
difficulty to prevent a loss of confidence spreading through the 
financial system as a whole.
in some cases, confidence can best be sustained if the sarb’s 
support is disclosed only when the conditions giving rise to a 
potentially systemic disturbance have improved. accordingly, 
although the financial effects of such operations will be included 
in the financial statements in the year in which they occur, these 
financial statements may not explicitly identify the existence of 
such support. however, such support will be reported when the 
need for secrecy or confidentiality has ceased.
subsidiaries
the subsidiaries of the sarb are:
• the south african mint company (rf) proprietary limited 
(south african mint) which produces circulation and 
collectable coins, and its subsidiary prestige bullion which 
produces bullion coins.
• the south african bank note company (rf) proprietary 
limited which produces banknotes.
• the corporation for public deposits (cpd) which receives 
and invests call deposits from the sa government and 
public entities.
• the corporation for deposit insurance (codi) provides 
deposit insurance and carries out its functions to support the 
sarb in fulfilling its objective of, and responsibility for, 
protecting and maintaining financial stability.
• information on the sarb’s financial interest in its subsidiaries 
is provided in note 33.
the subsidiaries did not pass any special resolutions that are 
material to the ing year.
associate
abhl, an associate of the sarb, is the public holding 
company of african insurance group limited and african bank 
limited (abl).
information on the sarb’s financial interest in its associate is 
provided in note 33.

strategic objectives.

financial results
the net investment income of the sarb, derived mainly from 
foreign investments and accommodation to banks, increased 
by r19.3 billion to r26.5 billion (2022/23: r4.4 billion increase 
to r7.2 billion). operating costs increased by r0.5 billion to 
r8.5 billion (2022/23: r0.9 billion increase to r8.0 billion).
the investment in abhl has been impaired by nine hundred 
and eighty two million in the current year (2022/23: r0.6 billion 
impairment reversal). the net result of these factors was a profit 
after taxation of r13.0 billion (2022/23: r0.8 billion) for the year 
ended 31 march 2024.
the south african mint (including prestige bullion) made a profit 
after taxation of r0.2 billion (2022/23: r0.4 billion), attributable 
to the group, and did not declare a dividend (2022/23: 
r0.3 billion) to the sarb.
the sabn’s profit after taxation has decreased from the prior 
year to a r0.1 billion loss (2022/23: r0.2 billion profit).
the cpd’s profit after taxation has increased from the prior year 
to r0.9 billion (2022/23: r0.5 billion). for the year ended 
31 march 2024, there was no amount due to the sa 
government (2022/23: rnil) in accordance with the cpd act.
abhl made a profit after taxation of r0.2 billion (2022/23: 
r0.2 billion), attributable to the group. the directors have noted 
the recent acquisitions of ubank and grindrod bank and will 
continue to monitor the performance of the associate. 
refer to note 33.3 for further detail.
financial position
the sarb’s total assets increased by r76.0 billion to r1.3 trillion 
(2022/23: r201.0 billion increase to r1.2 trillion), largely due to 
increases in gold and fx reserves of r86.0 billion.
the total assets of the south african mint (including prestige 
bullion) increased by r0.4 billion to r3.0 billion (2022/23: 
r0.5 billion decrease to r2.6 billion), mainly attributable to a 
higher inventory balance at the reporting date.
the sabn’s total assets decreased by r0.2 billion to r2.6 billion 
(2022/23: r0.2 billion increase to r2.8 billion), attributable to 
lower call deposit investments.
the cpd’s total assets increased by r4.7 billion to r113.0 billion 
(2022/23: r16.5 billion increase to r108.05 billion), largely as a 
result of a net increase in short-term fixed deposits, offset by a 
decrease in money market investments.
during the 2020/21 financial year, a counterparty defaulted on 
its promissory notes which resulted in the recognition of a fair 
value loss. as at 31 march 2024, the outstanding nominal value 
of the debt was r0.5 billion. capital repayments of r0.2 billion 
were received from that counterparty during the current financial 
year (2022/23: r0.2 billion). the directors are monitoring 
communication from the counterparty on the possible 
restructure of the debt.
the total liabilities of the sarb increased by r85.0 billion to 
r1.2 trillion (2022/23: r200.0 billion increase to r1.1 trillion), 
largely due to a r73.0 billion increase in gfecra.
the total liabilities of the south african mint (including 
prestige bullion) increased by r0.2 billion to r1.4 billion 
(2022/23: r0.4 billion increase to r1.2 billion), mainly 
attributable to an increase in trade payables.
the sabn’s total liabilities decreased by r0.1 billion to r0.5 billion 
(2022/23: remained consistent at r0.6 billion), mainly due to a 
decrease in accruals and accounts payable.
the cpd’s total liabilities increased by r4.0 billion to r112.0 billion 
(2022/23: r16.0 billion increase to r108.6 billion), largely due to an 
increase in deposits of r4.0 billion.
the sarb’s contingency reserve increased by r13.0 billion to 
r33.4 billion (2022/23: r0.8 billion increase to r20.4 billion) 
due to a transfer of the current year profit after taxation of 
r13.0 billion to the contingency reserve.
further details on the group’s financial information for the year 
can be found on .
dividends
the sarb act permits the sarb to declare dividends from its 
accumulated profits (reserves). as per the sarb act, a total 
dividend at the rate of 10% per annum on the paid-up share 
capital of the sarb was paid as follows:
• an interim dividend of five cents per share was approved by 
the board on 27 july 2023 and paid to shareholders on 
27 october 2023; and
• the final dividend of five cents per share was approved by the 
board on 22 february 2024 and paid to shareholders on 
31 may 2024.
the total dividend paid for the financial year was r0.2 million 
(2022/23: r0.2 million).

combined assurance
the group has adopted a combined assurance approach, in 
line with king iv™, to increase the effectiveness of assurance 
activities by the functionaries within the three lines of assurance. 
the combined assurance model has been subjected to ongoing 
enhancements and has reached a high level of maturity, 
ensuring regular interaction, alignment of assessment 
methodologies, and effective and integrated dashboard-based 
reporting across the three lines of assurance. the caf ensures 
the ongoing review of the approach, model and processes as 
well as regular discussions, information sharing and 
coordination of efforts between the respective assurance 
providers. this approach contributes significantly towards an 
effective control environment and supports the integrity of 
information used for internal decision-making by management, 
the board and its committees. based on reports submitted by 
the three lines of assurance and the caf, the committee 
considers the adopted combined assurance approach to be 
adequate, effective and aligned to good practices to ensure the 
achievement of the said objective of effective assurance 
activities across the group.
financial statements
after reviewing the sarb group annual financial statements 
and the associated external auditors’ report, the audit 
committee recommended their approval to the board. the 
audit committee is satisfied with the going concern status 
of the sarb.
internal audit
the audit committee reviewed and approved the internal audit 
charter, which defines the purpose, authority and responsibility 
of the internal audit function. the audit committee approved 
the internal audit strategy, the annual internal audit plan, 
including changes to the plan, and the internal audit resources 
required to deliver on the plan. the audit committee also 
reviewed the iad’s quarterly reports, including their assessment 
of the state of the internal control environment.
the audit committee received feedback on the internal quality 
assurance and improvement process review which resulted in 
an overall assessment of ‘generally conforms’ with the iia 
standards promulgated by the institute. the independent 
external quality assurance was conducted in may 2022 and 
the next review is due in 2026.
the audit committee is satisfied that the iad is independent 
and appropriately resourced to provide assurance on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the sarb’s internal control 
environment. the chief internal auditor reports functionally to 
the audit committee and administratively to the governor.
introduction
the audit committee is a subcommittee of the sarb board. 
all its members, including the chairperson, are independent 
non-executive directors. the responsibilities of the audit 
committee are set out in its terms of reference, which are 
approved by the board and reviewed every three years or 
more frequently, if required.
the audit committee carried out its oversight functions 
independently and in full compliance with its terms of reference 
during the reporting year.
the sarb’s executive management, internal auditors, external 
auditors and other assurance providers attended all the audit 
committee meetings in an ex officio capacity. management as 
well as internal and external auditors met independently with 
the audit committee, as appropriate.
roles and responsibilities
the audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities in terms of the ing 
processes, risks and system of internal financial controls as well 
as the sarb’s processes for monitoring compliance with laws 
and regulations. the audit committee can confirm that its 
members were independent from the sarb for the period 
under review and had no other relationship with the sarb that 
could interfere with the fulfilment of their duties.
internal control (including internal 
financial controls)
the sarb’s system of internal financial controls is designed 
to ensure:
• the integrity and reliability of financial information;
• compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;
• the achievement of objectives;
• economy and efficiency of operations; and
• the safeguarding of assets.
the audit committee is satisfied that the system of internal 
financial controls is adequately designed and operated 
effectively to form a sound basis for the preparation of reliable 
financial reports. this assessment is based on reports from 
management, risk management, internal auditors and external 
auditors.
the audit committee considered, and is satisfied with, the 
expertise and experience of the group cfo with respect to the 
preparation of the annual financial statements. the finance 
function in the sarb has the expertise and adequate resources 
to support the group cfo.

for the year ended 31 march 2024

annual financial statements 2023/24
external audit
the audit committee is satisfied with the independence of the 
external auditors of the sarb. this assessment was made after 
considering the independence letters from the external auditors, 
continuous monitoring and approval of non-audit services as 
well as a formal partner rotation process and audit firm rotation. 
the audit committee reviewed the external auditors’ proposed 
audit scope, approach and audit fees for the year under review.
non-audit services
the audit committee is responsible for approving the sarb 
policy on the provision of non-audit services by the sarb’s 
external auditors. the sarb policy on the award of non-audit 
services to the external auditors is used by the audit committee 
as the primary reference point in setting and approving the 
limits for such awards. the non-audit services limits are set at 
levels that safeguard the external auditors’ independence to 
ensure that such non-audit services do not create a public 
perception of a conflict of interest for the external auditors.
the awarding of non-audit services to external auditors and 
their networks is delegated for approval by the fsd of the 
sarb, only to the extent of the limits that are set and approved 
by the governors' executive committee (gec) and the audit 
committee. any non-audit services exceeding the limits set and 
approved by the audit committee cannot be awarded to the 
external auditors without prior approval by the audit committee.
for the past four years, the sarb board has approved forensic 
investigations carried out into the alleged contravention of the 
exchange control regulations of 1961. the assignment 
required specialist forensic skills and expertise. pwc advisory 
services (pty) limited (pwc) was appointed by gildenhuys 
malatji incorporated (gmi) to investigate the alleged 
contravention of the regulations after gmi was appointed by 
the sarb to conduct the forensic investigation.
the audit committee monitored the non-audit fees associated 
with these forensic investigations to ensure prior approval, a 
practice that ended once pwc ceased to be the sarb’s 
external auditor. consequently, their non-audit fees no longer 
require approval by the audit committee.
pricewaterhousecoopers inc. (pwc inc.) stepped down as the 
external auditors of the sarb group after the completion of the 
audit work for the financial year ended 31 march 2023. the 
audit committee was satisfied with the process of selecting a 
firm of independent external auditors, bdo south africa 
incorporated (bdo), as the new joint external auditor of the 
sarb group.
the non-audit fees for the financial year ending 31 march 2024 
are well below the predetermined limits outlined in the sarb 
policy on the provision of non-audit services by the sarb’s 
external auditors.
compliance
the audit committee is satisfied that, for the current year, the 
sarb has implemented appropriate processes and controls to 
ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations as 
they relate to financial reporting. this is based on the audit 
committee’s review of reports received from both internal and 
external auditors as well as from executive management and 
relevant departments.
information and technology
the audit committee is satisfied with the sarb’s i&t capability 
and that its i&t controls are appropriate to support the integrity 
of financial reporting.
this is based on the audit committee’s continuous review of 
assurance reports from the gec and the internal and external 
auditors.
the audit committee notes the rapidly growing technology 
footprint within the sarb through the ongoing execution of 
large transformation projects and the replacement of legacy 
systems in line with the sarb’s strategic objectives.
whistle-blowing
based on the combined submissions from the rmcd and iad 
at the brec, the audit committee is satisfied with the sarb’s 
procedures to receive, evaluate, investigate and report on 
confidential and anonymous complaints regarding matters of 
integrity and ethics at the sarb.

presentation
in the financial statements,
1. not all information as required by ifrs 7 financial 
instruments disclosures is disclosed.
this relates specifically to:
 a. market risk for all financial assets (foreign and local): the 
sensitivity analysis for each type of market risk to which 
the ing date, showing how 
profit or loss and equity/other comprehensive income 
(oci) would have been affected by changes in the 
relevant risk variables that were reasonably possible at 
that date;
 b. credit risk for foreign financial assets: the credit quality 
per counterparty (issuer) and per country, the historical 
information about the counterparty default rates, and 
instruments per counterparty; and
 c. credit risk for local financial assets: the credit quality per 
counterparty (issuer) and instrument class, the historical 
information about the counterparty default rates and a 
breakdown of instruments per counterparty.
central banking
the sarb, as the mandated central bank of south africa, will 
exercise discretion on ‘lender of last resort’ activities as it 
relates to the management and oversight responsibilities of the 
domestic financial market operation.
reporting framework
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the sarb act and the accounting policies set out in note 1.
the sarb act is not prescriptive regarding the accounting 
framework that the sarb should adopt, except for sections 
25 to 28, which deal with the accounting treatment of gold and 
fx transactions.
these sections are in conflict with the ifrs accounting 
standards as issued by the international accounting standards 
board. the sarb has chosen to use ifrs accounting 
standards, including ifrs accounting standards interpretations 
committee interpretations, as a guide in deciding on the most 
appropriate accounting policies to adopt, and as a model for the 
presentation and disclosure framework followed in its financial 
statements.
however, the sarb act takes precedence over ifrs accounting 
standards in the areas noted above and, as a result, the 
recognition and measurement criteria as set out in ifrs 
accounting standards have not been followed in these 
circumstances. in addition, the sarb considers certain 
recognition and measurement principles as well as disclosures 
inappropriate to its functions. the sarb’s financial statements 
therefore disclose less detail than would be required under ifrs 
accounting standards. the significant departures from ifrs 
accounting standards as a consequence of the above are 
summarised as follows:
recognition and measurement
1. according to the sarb act,
 a. realised and unrealised valuation gains and losses on 
gold, and realised and unrealised fx gains and losses 
on foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are for the 
account of the sa government, and have therefore not 
been accounted for in profit or loss, as required by 
international accounting standard (ias) 21 the effects 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. these valuation 
gains and losses are accumulated in gfecra, for the 
account of the sa government. the gfecra balance is 
therefore also not accounted for in accordance with ifrs 
accounting standards; and
 b. gold is valued in terms of section 25 of the sarb act at 
the statutory gold price. gold has been recognised as a 
financial asset of the sarb.

we conducted our audit in accordance with the international standards on auditing (isas). our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and 
separate financial statements section of our report. we are independent of the group in accordance with the 
independent regulatory board for auditors’ code of professional conduct for registered auditors (irba code) 
and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements in south africa. we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the irba code and in accordance with other 
ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in south africa. the irba code is consistent with the 
corresponding sections of the international ethics standards board for accountants’ international code of ethics 
for professional accountants (including international independence standards). we believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
emphasis of matter - basis of accounting 
 
we draw attention to note 1 to the consolidated and separate financial statements, which describes the basis of 
accounting. the consolidated and separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with the sarb’s own 
accounting policies and the requirements of the sarb act to satisfy the financial information needs of the sarb’s 
shareholders. as a result, the consolidated and separate financial statements may not be suitable for another 
purpose. our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
 
other information 
 
the directors are responsible for the other information. the other information comprises the information included 
in the document titled “ annual financial statements 2023/24” and the document 
titled “ annual report 2023/24”. the other information does not include the 
consolidated and separate financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
 
our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we 
do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
consolidated and separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. if, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. we have nothing to report in this 
regard. 
 
responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated and separate financial statements 
 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements in 
accordance with the basis of accounting described in note 1 to the consolidated and separate financial 
statements and the requirements of the sarb act, for determining that the basis of preparation is acceptable in 
the circumstances and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of the consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
 
in preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the 
sarb’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group and/or the 
sarb or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements 
 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated and separate financial statements. 
 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
 
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the group’s and the sarb’s internal control. 
• conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the group’s and sarb’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related 
disclosures in the consolidated and separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ 
report. however, future events or conditions may cause the group and/or the sarb to cease to continue as 
a going concern. 
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the directors. 
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion. 
 
we communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.

judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements, are 
disclosed in note 1.21 and the relevant notes.
the accounting policies have been applied consistently to all 
years presented, except for the changes described alongside.
1.2 new standards and interpretations
1.2.1 new and amended standards adopted 
by the group
in the current year, the group adopted the following standards 
and interpretations that are effective for the current financial 
year and that are relevant to its operations:
amendments to ias 1 and ifrs practice statement 
2: disclosure of accounting policies
ias 1 was amended to require that only material accounting 
policy information be disclosed in the financial statements. 
the amendment will not result in changes to measurement or 
recognition of financial statement items, but management has 
reviewed the accounting policies and ensured that only material 
accounting policy information is disclosed. the effective date of 
the amendment is for years beginning on or after 1 january 2023. 
the group has adopted the amendment for the first time in the 
2024 consolidated and separate annual financial statements 
and updated the disclosures to only include information 
considered to be material.
amendments to ias 8: definition of accounting 
estimates
the definition of accounting estimates was amended so that 
accounting estimates are now defined as “monetary amounts in 
annual financial statements that are subject to measurement 
uncertainty.” the effective date of the amendment is for years 
beginning on or after 1 january 2023. the group has adopted 
the amendment for the first time in the 2024 annual financial 
statements and the impact of the amendment is not material.
ifrs 17 insurance contracts
ifrs 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance 
contracts issued. the effective date of the standard is for years 
beginning on or after 1 january 2023. management has 
assessed the requirements of the standard and its applicability

1. accounting policies
1.1 basis of preparation
the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. these accounting 
policies should be read together with the financial reporting 
framework on .
these financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis, in accordance with the sarb act and the 
accounting policies set out in this note. the directors have 
considered the impact of the volatility in financial markets, mainly 
as a result of interest rate hikes by central banks globally in an 
attempt to curb the steep rise in inflation, amongst other factors.
the directors have also considered the impact of the ongoing 
russia-ukraine and israeli-palestinian conflict. although the 
group has no direct exposure to the affected countries, the 
conflict continues to negatively impact financial markets in 
general. the directors have concluded that the impact of the 
volatility in financial markets has no material effect on the going 
concern of the sarb and its subsidiaries. these matters will 
however, be monitored and included in the considerations for 
forward-looking information. the use of the going concern 
assumption is therefore deemed to be appropriate.
these financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except where fair value basis is considered more 
appropriate.
these financial statements comprise the consolidated and 
separate statement of financial position as at 31 march 2024, 
consolidated and separate statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, consolidated and separate statement 
of changes in equity and consolidated and separate statement 
of cash flows for the year ended 31 march 2024, as well as the 
notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies 
and other explanatory notes.
in accordance with the financial sector regulation act 9 of 
2017 (fsr act) separate financial accounts in relation to the 
prudential authority are required. the prudential authority 
financial accounts are included on pages 102 to 107.
the group's functional and presentation currency is the south 
african rand and all amounts presented for the current and 
comparative years are rounded to the nearest million, unless 
otherwise stated. the amounts in the prior year financial 
statements were rounded to the nearest thousand and this was 
changed in the current year.
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of 
certain key accounting estimates. it also requires management 
to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting 
policies of the group. the areas with a higher degree of

1.2 new standards and interpretations 
continued
1.2.1 new and amended standards adopted 
by the group continued
amendments to ias 12: deferred taxation related to 
assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction
the amendment adds an additional requirement for 
transactions which will not give rise to the recognition of a 
deferred taxation asset or liability on initial recognition. 
previously, deferred taxation would not be recognised on the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is 
not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting profit or loss. the additional 
requirement provides that the transaction, at the time of the 
transaction must not give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences. the effective date of the amendment is 
for years beginning on or after 1 january 2023. the group has 
adopted the amendment for the first time in the 2024 
consolidated and separate annual financial statements and the 
impact of the amendment is not material.
amendments to ias 12: international tax reform: 
pillar two model rules
the amendments incorporate into ias 12, taxes arising from tax 
law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the pillar 
two model rules published by the organisation for economic 
co-operation and development. as an exception, deferred tax 
assets and liabilities related to pillar two income taxes should 
not be recognised, nor information about them disclosed. an 
entity is required to disclose that this exception has been 
applied and any current tax income or expense related to pillar 
two income taxes is required to be disclosed separately. in 
addition, where the legislation is not yet effective, disclosure is 
required for known or reasonably estimable information of the 
entity's exposure to pillar two taxes arising from that legislation. 
the effective date of the amendment is for years beginning on 
or after 1 january 2023. the group has adopted the 
amendment for the first time in the 2024 consolidated and 
separate annual financial statements however, there is no 
impact in the current financial year as the south african 
government has not yet enacted legislation relating to the 
pillar two model rules.
management has reviewed the draft bill published by the 
sa government for public comment and concluded that the 
legislation will not be applicable to the group. however, 
updates to the draft bill will be monitored until the legislation 
is final.
there are no other new or amended standards applicable to 
the group for the financial year ended 31 march 2024.
1.2.2 new standards, amendments and 
interpretations not yet adopted by the group
several new standards, amendments and interpretations 
are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 january 2024 and have not been early adopted in 
preparing these financial statements. the group will adopt 
these amendments in the relevant financial year in which they 
become effective. these are as follows:
amendment to ias 1: classification of liabilities as 
current or non-current
the amendment clarifies the requirements to classify a liability 
as current or non-current. if an entity has the right at the end of 
the reporting period, to defer settlement of a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period, then the liability is 
classified as non-current. if this right is subject to conditions 
imposed on the entity, then the right only exists, if, at the end of 
the reporting period, the entity has complied with those 
conditions. in addition, the classification is not affected by 
the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer 
settlement. therefore, if the right exists, the liability is classified 
as non-current even if management intends or expects to settle 
the liability within twelve months of the reporting period. 
additional disclosures would be required in such circumstances. 
the effective date of the amendment is for years beginning on 
or after 1 january 2024. it is unlikely that the amendment will 
have a material impact on the group's financial statements.
amendments to ias 1: non-current liabilities with 
covenants
the amendment improves the information an entity provides 
when its right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve 
months is subject to compliance with covenants. the 
amendment also provides guidance on when to classify 
liabilities arising from covenants as current or non-current. 
additional disclosures will be required in the notes to the annual 
financial statements if an entity classifies liabilities arising from 
covenants as non-current. the effective date of the amendment 
is for years beginning on or after 1 january 2024. it is unlikely 
that the amendment will have a material impact on the group’s 
financial statements.
amendments to ifrs 16: lease liability in a sale and 
leaseback
the amendment requires that a seller-lessee in a sale and 
leaseback transaction, shall determine ‘lease payments’ or 
‘revised lease payments’ in a way that the seller-lessee would 
not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to 
the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. the effective 
date of the amendment is for years beginning on or after 
1 january 2024. it is unlikely that the amendment will have 
a material impact on the group's financial statements.

in the separate financial statements of the sarb, investments 
in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment. where 
appropriate, the cost includes loans to subsidiaries with no 
repayment terms, where these are considered part of the 
investment in subsidiaries. impairment on investments in 
subsidiaries is discussed in note 33.
intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between the group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation.
1.3.2 investment in associate
an associate is an entity over which the group has significant 
influence but not control or joint control. this is generally the 
case where the group holds between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights.
1.4 financial instruments
1.4.1 financial assets
classification
the group classifies its financial assets into the following 
measurement categories:
• amortised cost;
• fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci);
• fair value through profit or loss (fvpl); and
• instruments measured in terms of the sarb act.
the group determines the classification of financial assets 
based on both the group's business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of 
the financial asset. classification of a financial instrument into a 
category occurs at initial recognition.
for debt instruments, the business model test and cash flow 
characteristics of solely payments of principal and interest 
(sppi) test are applied by the group in determining the category 
which best applies to the financial instruments that it holds and/
or trades. under the business model test the group determines 
the objective for which it holds the financial instrument:
• holding the financial asset to collect the contractual cash 
flows;
• selling the instrument prior to its contractual maturity to 
realise its fair value changes; or
• holding for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling 
the assets.
factors considered by the group in determining the business 
model of a group of assets include past experience on how the 
cash flows for these assets are collected, how the asset’s 
performance is evaluated and reported to key management 
personnel, how risks are assessed and managed and how 
managers are compensated. the business model test is 
performed before the sppi test.

1.2.2 new standards, amendments and 
interpretations not yet adopted by the group

amendments to ias 7 and ifrs 7: disclosures: 
supplier finance arrangements
the amendment applies to circumstances where supplier 
finance arrangements exist. these are arrangements where 
finance providers pay the suppliers of the entity, thus providing 
the entity with extended payment terms or the suppliers with 
early payment terms. the entity then pays the finance providers 
based on their specific terms and conditions. the amendment 
requires the disclosure of information about supplier finance 
arrangements that enable users of financial statements to 
assess the effects of those arrangements on the entity's 
liabilities and cash flows as well as on the entity's exposure to 
liquidity risk. the effective date of the amendment is for years 
beginning on or after 1 january 2024. it is unlikely that the 
amendment will have a material impact on the group's financial 
statements.
amendments to ias 21: lack of exchangeability
the amendments apply to currencies which are not 
exchangeable. the definition of exchangeable is provided as 
being when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within 
a time frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and 
through a market or exchange mechanism in which an 
exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and 
obligations. the amendments require an entity to estimate the 
spot exchange rate at measurement date when a currency is 
not exchangeable into another currency. additional disclosures 
are also required to enable users of financial statements to 
understand the impact of the non-exchangeability on financial 
performance, financial position and cash flow. the effective 
date of the amendment is for years beginning on or after 
1 january 2025. it is unlikely that the amendment will have 
a material impact on the group's financial statements.
there are no other ifrs accounting standards or international 
financial reporting interpretations committee interpretations 
that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a 
material impact on the group.
1.3 group accounting
1.3.1 subsidiaries
subsidiaries are all entities over which the sarb has control. 
the sarb controls an entity when the sarb is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power to direct the activities of the entity. subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to 
the sarb.

the group's policy is to designate equity instruments as fvoci 
when those instruments are held for purposes other than to 
generate investment returns.
the bis shares are held as part of the sarb's function as a 
central bank and not to generate investment returns. in 
accordance with the group's policy, these shares have been 
designated at fvoci. refer to note 11 for further disclosure.
fair value through profit or loss
positive derivatives, assets that do not meet the criteria for 
amortised cost, fvoci, and that are not specifically excluded in 
terms of sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act are measured at 
fvpl. assets can be designated at fvpl at initial recognition if 
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency.
financial assets held at mandatory fvpl include:
• investments;
• derivatives (forward exchange contracts (fecs), futures 
contracts and interest rate swaps); and
• sa government bonds.
the sarb seeks to minimise the effects of currency and 
interest rate risks by using such instruments to economically 
hedge the related risk exposures. the sarb does not enter 
into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial 
instruments, for proprietary trading purposes. refer to note 6 
for further disclosure
instruments measured in terms of the sarb act
sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act prescribe the accounting 
treatment for specific financial assets, which takes precedent 
over ifrs accounting standards. the accounting treatment 
prescribed by the sarb act for these specific financial assets is 
not in line with the requirements of ifrs 9 financial instruments 
(ifrs 9) therefore, these instruments are not classified in 
accordance with ifrs 9 for reporting purposes. the financial 
reporting framework of the sarb specifically refers to this 
deviation from ifrs accounting standards.
the following assets are governed by sections 25 to 28 of the 
sarb act and thus not classified in terms of ifrs 9:
• gold;
• special drawing rights (sdr) reserves; and
• fec assets.
the fecs are used for monetary policy operations of the sarb 
and exposures for both assets and liabilities are matched 
economically. the group has elected to not apply hedge 
accounting per ifrs 9. refer to note 8 for further disclosure.
1. accounting policies continued
1.4 financial instruments continued
1.4.1 financial assets continued
classification continued
under the sppi test, the group determines whether the 
collection of contractual cash flows represent sppi on specified 
dates. in making this assessment, the group considers whether 
the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending 
arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for time 
value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit 
margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. 
financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered 
in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows 
are sppi.
financial assets, excluding instruments measured in terms of 
the sarb act, are classified into measurement categories as 
follows:
• financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual 
cash flows, where those cash flows represent sppi, are 
measured at amortised cost;
• financial assets that are held for trading or to realise fair value 
changes prior to contractual maturity are measured at fvpl; 
and
• financial assets that are held for both the collection of 
contractual cash flows and for sale are measured at fvoci.
amortised cost
assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows 
where those cash flows represent sppi, and that are not 
specifically excluded in terms of sections 25 to 28 of the sarb 
act or designated at fvpl, are measured at amortised cost. 
financial assets held at amortised cost include: 
• cash and cash equivalents;
• accommodation to banks;
• investments;
• loans and advances; and
• other financial assets.
fair value through other comprehensive income
financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash 
flows and for selling the assets, where the assets’ cash flows 
represents sppi, and that are not specifically excluded in terms 
of sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act or designated at fvpl, 
are measured at fvoci.
if an equity instrument is held for purposes other than to 
generate investment returns, the group can make an 
irrevocable election at initial recognition to measure it at fvoci.

1. accounting policies continued
1.4 financial instruments continued
1.4.1 financial assets continued
initial recognition
financial assets are recognised when the group becomes party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. regular way 
purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on 
trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset. from this date, any gains or losses arising 
from changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are 
recognised.
financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs, except those carried at fvpl. transaction 
costs of financial assets carried at fvpl are expensed in profit 
or loss. after initial recognition, an expected credit loss (ecl) 
allowance is recognised for financial assets measured at 
amortised cost and fvoci, as described in note 28.2.2, which 
results in an accounting loss being recognised in profit or loss 
when an asset is newly originated.
the best evidence of fair value on initial recognition is the 
transaction price, unless fair value is evidenced by comparison 
with other observable current market transactions in the same 
instrument or based on discounted cash flow models and 
option- pricing valuation techniques whose variables include 
data from observable markets.
when the fair value of financial assets differs from the 
transaction price on initial recognition, the group recognises the 
difference as follows:
• when the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an 
active market for an identical asset (i.e. a level 1 input) or 
based on a valuation technique that uses only data from 
observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain 
or loss.
• in all other cases, the difference is deferred, and the timing 
of recognition of the deferred day one profit or loss is 
determined individually. it is either amortised over the life of 
the instrument, deferred until the instrument's fair value can 
be determined using market observable inputs, or realised 
through settlement.
subsequent measurement 
equity instruments
all equity investments are valued at fair value with value 
changes recognised in profit or loss except where the group 
has elected to present the fair value changes in oci.
debt instruments
amortised cost
the carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by an ecl 
allowance recognised and measured as described in note 
28.2.2. amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest 
method that discounts the estimated future cash payments or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to 
the net carrying amount of the financial asset. interest income 
using the effective interest method from these financial assets is 
included in profit or loss.
fair value through profit or loss
a fair value gain or loss on a debt instrument subsequently 
measured at fvpl is recognised in profit or loss. interest 
income using the effective interest method from these financial 
assets is included in profit or loss.
fair value through other comprehensive income
fair value movements in the carrying amount are recognised in 
oci, except for the recognition of impairment losses or 
reversals and interest revenue on the instrument's amortised 
cost which are recognised in profit or loss and changes in fair 
value due to foreign exchange movements as explained in note 
1.6. when the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in oci is reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss.
instruments measured in terms of the sarb act
in terms of sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act, all gains and 
losses on gold held by the sarb and foreign exchange profits 
or losses of the sarb (as explained in note 1.6), insofar as they 
arise from changes in the value of the rand compared to other 
currencies, are for the account of sa government. therefore, all 
these profits or losses are transferred to the gfecra.
impairment of financial assets
the group assesses, on a forward-looking basis, the ecl 
associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost, 
debt instruments carried at fvoci and the exposure arising 
from loan commitments. the group recognises a loss 
allowance for such losses at each reporting date. no loss 
allowance is recognised on equity instruments.
the measurement of ecl reflects:
• an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is 
determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
• the time value of money; and
• reasonable and supportable information that is available 
without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past 
events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic 
conditions.

ecl measurement
ifrs 9 outlines a ‘three-stage’ model for impairment based on 
changes in credit quality since initial recognition. the group 
applies the same model for all financial assets and is 
summarised below:
• a financial instrument that has not experienced a significant 
increase in credit risk (sicr) since initial recognition and is not 
credit-impaired is classified in 'stage 1' and has its credit risk 
continuously monitored by the group.
• if a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition is 
evident, the financial instrument is moved to 'stage 2' but is 
not yet deemed to be credit impaired. please refer to note 
28.2.2.1 for a description of how the group determines when 
a sicr has occurred.
• if the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial 
instrument is then moved to 'stage 3'. please refer to note 
28.2.2.2 for a description of how the group defines credit 
impaired and default.
• financial instruments in stage 1 have their ecl measured at 
an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ecl that result 
from default events possible within the next 12 months. 
financial instruments in stages 2 or 3 have their ecl 
measured on a lifetime basis.
• purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets are 
those financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial 
recognition. their ecl is always measured on a lifetime basis 
(stage 3).
the group uses the following key inputs in its model for 
measuring ecl:
• probability of default (pd);
• loss given default (lgd); and
• exposure at default (ead).
please refer to note 28.2.2.3 for a description of inputs, 
assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring 
the ecl.
• a pervasive concept in measuring ecl in accordance with 
ifrs 9 is that it should consider forward-looking information. 
note 28.2.2.4 includes an explanation of how the group has 
incorporated this in its ecl models.
the ecl assessment in terms of the financial guarantees 
provided to the commercial banks under the loan guarantee 
scheme (lgs), bounce back scheme (bbs) and energy bounce 
back scheme (ebbs) are summarised below:
• the ecl allowances calculated by the commercial banks for 
the portfolio of borrowings under the lgs, bbs, and ebbs 
are obtained and reviewed by the group. similar to the 
group, the commercial banks follow a "three-stage" model 
for impairment based on changes in the credit quality since 
initial recognition and use the same key inputs in their models 
for measuring ecl.
• the lgs ecl allowance is reduced by the guarantee fee 
premium which serves as the first and second loss buffer 
under the waterfall for recovery of losses and thereafter by a 
6% borrowers risk portion (third loss buffer) which is borne by 
the commercial banks. the lgs ecl allowance that remains 
after taking into account the first to third loss buffers will be 
recognised as an ecl in terms of the financial guarantee. 
the sarb’s obligations under the lgs are covered by a full 
back-to-back guarantee from the sa government.
• the bbs and ebbs ecl allowance is limited to the 
maximum amount guaranteed by the sarb, being 20.5% of 
the capital amount advanced to commercial banks. the 
sarb's obligations under the bbs and ebbs are covered by 
a full back-to-back guarantee from the sa government.
write off policy
• the group writes off financial assets when it has exhausted 
all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is 
no reasonable expectation of recovery. indicators thereof 
include ceasing enforcement activities or where the collateral 
value indicates that there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery.
• financial assets that are written off could still be subject to 
enforcement activities in order to comply with the group's 
procedures for recovery of amounts due.
• the key judgements and assumptions adopted by the group 
in addressing the requirements of the standard are discussed 
in note 28.2.2.1.
derecognition of financial assets
financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the assets have expired, or where the group 
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
collateral furnished by the group under standard repurchase 
agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions 
is not derecognised because the group retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined 
repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore 
not met.

1.4.2 financial liabilities
classification
the group classifies financial liabilities into the following 
measurement categories:
• amortised cost;
• fvpl; and
• instruments measured in terms of the sarb act.
the group classifies a financial instrument that it issues as a 
financial liability in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual agreement. management determines the 
classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition. due to 
the sarb’s mandate as a central bank and ‘lender of last 
resort’, movements in financial liabilities are classified as 
operating activities in the statement of cash flows.
financial liabilities at amortised cost
all financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for 
liabilities specifically excluded in terms of sections 25 to 28 of 
the sarb act and financial liabilities measured at fvpl, 
including derivatives.
financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include:
• notes and coins in circulation;
• deposits; and
• other financial liabilities.
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
liabilities managed, and whose performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis and financial liabilities so designated are 
measured at fvpl.
financial liabilities held at fvpl include:
• foreign deposits.
instruments measured in terms of the sarb act
sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act prescribe the accounting 
treatment for specific financial liabilities, which takes precedent 
over ifrs accounting standards. the accounting treatment 
prescribed by the sarb act for these specific financial liabilities 
is not in line with the requirements of ifrs 9, therefore, these 
instruments are not classified in accordance with ifrs 9 for 
reporting purposes. the financial reporting framework of the 
sarb specifically refers to this deviation from ifrs accounting 
standards.
the following liabilities are governed in terms of sections 25 to 
28 of the sarb act and thus not classified in terms of ifrs 9:
• fec liabilities; and
• the gfecra.
initial recognition
the group recognises financial liabilities when it becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, generally 
being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred, 
except for financial liabilities at fvpl. the best evidence of fair 
value on initial recognition is the transaction price, unless the 
fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable 
current market transactions in the same instrument or based on 
discounted cash flow models and option-pricing valuation 
techniques whose variables include only data from observable 
markets.
subsequent measurement 
amortised cost
amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method 
that discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net 
carrying amount of the financial liability.
instruments measured in terms of the sarb act
in terms of sections 25 to 28 of the sarb act, all gains and 
losses on gold held by the sarb (as explained in note 1.6), and 
foreign exchange profits or losses of the sarb insofar as they 
arise from changes in the value of the rand compared to other 
currencies, are for the account of sa government. therefore, all 
these profits or losses are transferred to the gfecra.
fair value through profit or loss
subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are 
measured at fair value. all related, realised and unrealised gains 
or losses arising from changes in fair value, excluding changes 
in fair value due to foreign exchange movements as explained 
in note 1.6 are recognised in profit or loss.
derecognition of financial liabilities
the group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only 
when, the group's obligations are discharged, cancelled, expire 
or are substantially modified. the difference between the 
carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised, and the 
consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
1.4.3 effective interest rate
the effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. the effective interest rate is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows 
(excluding ecl, but including all fees on points paid or received 
that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, 
transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the debt instrument or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset 
or liability. for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial 
assets, the group calculates the credit-adjusted effective 
interest rate, which is calculated based on the amortised cost 
of the financial asset instead of its gross carrying amount and 
incorporates the impact of expected credit losses in estimated 
future cash flows.

renegotiated or otherwise modified and the renegotiation or 
modification does not result in the derecognition of that financial 
instrument, the gross carrying amount is recalculated as the 
present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash 
flows that are discounted at the financial instrument’s original 
effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate 
for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets). 
a modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss for the 
change in the gross carrying amount. any costs or fees 
incurred adjust the carrying amount of the modified financial 
instrument and are amortised over the remaining term of the 
modified financial instrument.
1.4.4 offsetting of financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net 
amount reported in the consolidated and separate statement of 
financial position where there is a current legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the 
liability simultaneously.
1.4.5 unrecognised financial assets and 
liabilities
guarantees
guarantees represent contracts where the group undertakes to 
make or receive specified payments to or from a counterparty, 
should a counterparty or the sarb incur loss as a result of a 
specified debtor failing to make payment when due in 
accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. this amount 
represents the maximum exposure not recognised in the 
statement of financial position.
1.5 fair value
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset 
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement 
date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price) 
regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique.
a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the asset 
in its highest and best use.
fair values are determined according to the fair value hierarchy 
based on the requirements in ifrs 13 fair value measurement. 
refer to note 30 for further details.
1.5.1 derivatives
a derivative is a financial instrument, the value of which 
changes in response to an underlying variable that requires little 
or no initial investment and is settled at a future date. fair 
values are obtained from quoted market prices (excluding 
transaction costs), dealer price quotations, discounted cash 
flow models and option-pricing models, which consider current 
market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as 
well as the time value of money.
1.5.2 foreign marketable money market 
investments
the fair value of foreign marketable money market investments 
is based on quoted bid rates, excluding transaction costs.
1.5.3 local and foreign portfolio investments 
including securities lending portfolio 
investments
the fair values of portfolio investments are valued using the 
quoted market values.
where these instruments are bank deposits, they are valued at 
nominal values plus accrued interest based on market rates. 
these values approximate fair values.
1.5.4 sa government bonds
listed bonds are valued using quoted fair values at year-end as 
supplied by the jse limited.
1.5.5 bis shares
the sarb’s investment in the bis is valued at the net asset 
value of the bis with a haircut of 30% applied. the net asset 
value of the shares is based on xdrs. xdrs are the currency in 
which sdrs are valued. the value of the xdr is calculated on 
the basis of a currency basket comprising the united states 
dollar, euro, chinese renminbi, japanese yen and pound 
sterling. the currency weights are adjusted each year by the 
imf, in accordance with changes in bilateral foreign exchange 
rates. this adjustment is not subject to sensitivity. changes in 
value due to foreign exchange movements are transferred to 
the gfecra in accordance with the sarb act.
1.5.6 valuable art
the fair value of valuable art is determined based on the price 
at which an orderly transaction to sell the assets would take 
place between market participants at the measurement date 
under current market conditions.
revaluations of valuable art are performed every three years 
by an independent, reliable valuator to ensure that the carrying 
amount does not differ materially from that which would be 
determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. 
in the absence of an official fair value assessment by an 
independent valuator, the insured value will be used as an 
indicator of fair value.

1.5.6 valuable art
if an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a 
revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in oci and 
accumulated in equity under the heading of ppe revaluation 
reserve. however, the increase shall be recognised in profit or 
loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the 
same asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
if an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a 
revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in profit or loss. 
however, the decrease shall be recognised in oci to the extent 
of any credit balance existing in the revaluation reserve in 
respect of that asset. the decrease recognised in oci reduces 
the amount accumulated in equity under the heading of 
revaluation reserve.
the ppe revaluation reserve included in equity in respect of an 
item of valuable art may be transferred directly to accumulated 
profit when the asset is derecognised.
1.6 foreign currency – exchange gains 
or losses arising in entity accounts
foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. foreign exchange profits or losses of the sarb, 
insofar as they arise from changes in the value of the rand 
compared to other currencies, are for the account of sa 
government and consequently all these profits or losses are 
transferred to the gfecra in terms of sections 25 to 28 of the 
sarb act. investment returns on foreign exchange reserves 
and interest paid on foreign loans are for the account of the 
sarb and are accounted for in profit or loss. gains and losses 
on conversion to the functional currency are recognised in profit 
or loss for the subsidiaries and associate.
1.7 property, plant and equipment
property, plant and equipment are tangible items that are held 
by the group for use in the production or supply of goods or 
services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes; and 
are expected to be used during more than one period.
property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost.
freehold land and items under construction are subsequently 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. valuable 
art whose fair value can be measured reliably is carried at the 
revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the 
revaluation less any subsequent accumulated impairment 
losses. other items of property, plant and equipment are 
subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
items under construction are not yet available for use therefore, 
these items are not depreciated. the residual values, useful life 
and the depreciation method of assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
the estimated average useful lives of assets are as follows:
item 
depreciation 
method 
average 
useful life
buildings straight line 50
land not depreciated indefinite
furniture and equipment straight line 2 to 28
vehicles straight line 5 to 7
valuable art not depreciated indefinite
work in progress not depreciated 
work in progress consists of items under construction and is 
measured at cost. work in progress is transferred to the related 
category of assets and depreciated accordingly when the asset 
is completed and available for use.
1.8 intangible assets
intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without 
physical substance which the group holds for its own use, and 
which are expected to be used for more than one year. this 
includes internally generated assets and purchased computer 
software. internally generated assets are disclosed separately.
purchased software and the direct costs associated with the 
customisation and installation thereof are capitalised.
expenditure on internally developed software is capitalised if it 
meets the criteria for capitalising development expenditure. 
other software development expenditure is charged to profit 
or loss when incurred.
amortisation is provided to write down the intangible assets, 
on a straight line basis, to their residual values. the estimated 
average useful lives of the assets are as follows:
item
depreciation 
method
average
useful life
purchased computer software straight line 2 to 10
internally generated computer 
software straight line 2 to 10
work in progress not amortised 
work in progress consists of items under development and is 
measured at cost. work in progress is transferred to the related 
category of assets and amortised accordingly when the asset is 
completed and available for use.
1.9 gold
gold is held by the sarb as part of its foreign reserves. in 
terms of section 25 of the sarb act, gold is recorded at the 
prevailing rates at initial recognition, including transaction costs. 
subsequent to initial measurement, it is valued at the statutory 
price. the statutory price is the quoted price at the reporting 
date. gold loans are measured at the quoted price at the 
reporting date. in terms of section 25 of the sarb act, all gains 
or losses on gold, held by the sarb, are for the account of the 
sa government and, transferred to the gfecra.

1.10 taxation
the taxation expense for the period comprises current and 
deferred taxation. management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. it 
establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of 
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
the charge for current taxation is based on the results for the 
year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or 
disallowed for taxation purposes. it is calculated using taxation 
rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the 
reporting date, and any adjustment for taxation payable for 
previous years.
deferred taxation is provided using the liability method, based 
on temporary differences. the amount of deferred taxation 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using 
taxation laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting 
date. deferred taxation is charged to profit or loss, except to 
the extent that it relates to a transaction that is recognised in 
oci or in equity. in this case, the taxation is also recognised in 
oci or in equity. the effect on deferred taxation of any changes 
in taxation rates is recognised in profit or loss, except to the 
extent that it relates to items previously charged or credited 
directly to equity or oci.
1.11 employee benefits
1.11.1 pension and retirement funds
group companies operate various pension schemes. the 
schemes are funded through employer and employee 
contributions to insurance companies or trustee-administered 
funds. all funds in which the group participates are defined 
contribution funds, however, there is an element within the 
sarb retirement fund which is deemed to be defined benefit in 
nature. this element, as detailed in note 19.3, is treated 
according to the principles of a defined benefit plan.
1.11.1.1 defined benefit plans
a defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount 
of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, 
usually dependent on one or more factors, such as age, years 
of service and compensation.
the expected costs of post-employment defined benefits are 
charged to profit or loss over the expected service life of the 
employees entitled to these benefits according to the projected 
unit credit method. costs are actuarially assessed, and expense 
adjustments and past-service costs resulting from plan 
amendments are amortised over the expected average 
remaining service life of the employees.
the liability recognised in the statement of financial position in 
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date, together 
with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and 
past-service costs. the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate 
bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited 
to equity in oci in the period in which they arise. 
remeasurements are not classified to profit or loss in 
subsequent periods. past-service costs are recognised in profit 
or loss at the earlier of the following dates: (i) when the plan 
amendment or curtailment occurs or, (ii) when the entity 
recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
1.11.1.2 defined contribution plans
a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity or fund. 
the group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay 
all employees’ benefits relating to employee service in the 
current and prior periods.
for defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. the contributions are recognised 
as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
1.11.2 post-employment benefits
the sarb provides post-employment medical and group life 
benefits to qualifying employees and retired personnel by 
subsidising a portion of their medical aid and group life 
contributions.
entitlement to these benefits is based on employment prior to 
a certain date and is conditional on employees remaining in 
service up to retirement age. the expected costs of post-
employment defined benefits are charged to profit or loss over 
the expected service life of the employees entitled to these 
benefits according to the projected unit credit method. costs 
are actuarially assessed, and expense adjustments and 
past-service costs resulting from plan amendments are 
amortised over the expected average remaining service life of 
the employees.
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited 
to oci in the period in which they arise. past-service costs are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, to the extent that they 
relate to retired employees or past-service.

1.11 employee benefits continued
1.11.3 leave pay accrual
employee entitlements to annual leave and long-service leave 
are recognised when they accrue to employees.
the leave pay accrual at the reporting date represents the 
present obligation to employees as a result of employees’ 
services provided up to the reporting date. the accrual is 
measured as the amount that is expected to be paid as a result 
of the unutilised leave entitlement that has accumulated at the 
reporting date.
1.12 sale and repurchase agreements
the group enters into sale and repurchase (repo) agreements 
with external counterparties as part of its monetary policy 
activities. where securities are sold under agreement to 
repurchase at a specific future date, at a specific future price, 
in exchange for cash, the securities sold are not derecognised. 
a liability for the amount received is recognised in deposits and 
measured at amortised cost.
where the group purchases securities under agreement to 
resell at a specific future date, at a specific future price, in 
exchange for cash, the securities purchased are not recognised 
by the group. these transactions are, in substance, 
collateralised advances. the advances are recognised as part 
of accommodation to banks and measured at amortised cost.
the differences between the purchase and sale prices are 
treated as interest and amortised over the expected life of the 
instruments using the effective interest method.
1.13 inventories
inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the cost of completion and 
selling expenses.
redundant and slow-moving inventories are identified and 
written down to their estimated economic or realisable values. 
raw materials are valued at cost according to the first-in, 
first-out basis by subsidiaries. some raw materials are valued 
at standard cost, which closely approximates actual cost on 
a first-in, first-out basis.
consumable stores are valued at the weighted-average cost 
price. maintenance spares are valued at average cost.
finished goods and work in progress are valued at direct costs 
of conversion and production overheads on a first-in, first-out 
basis. production overheads are included in the cost of 
manufactured goods, based on normal operating capacity.
note-printing and coin-minting expenses include ordering, 
printing, minting, freight, insurance and handling costs. these 
costs are recorded as part of work in progress for the sabn 
and the south african mint and are released to profit or loss 
when the currency is sold to the sarb.
1.14 cost of new currency
the sarb recognises the cost of new currency in profit or loss 
when the banknotes and coin are delivered, and the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the sarb.
1.15 cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise of deposits with banks 
and other short-term highly liquid money market investments 
with original maturities of three months or less (91 days and 
less). where the maturity date falls on a weekend or a public 
holiday, the next business day convention will apply; however, 
the investment will still be considered a 91-day investment. in 
the separate financial statements, no cash and cash equivalents 
are reflected due to the sarb’s role as a central bank in the 
creation of money.
the statement of cash flows includes cash on hand, bank 
deposits and money market instruments. this has been 
presented on the indirect method of preparation.
1.16 provisions
provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are 
recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events for which it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. provisions are measured at management’s 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle that obligation at 
the end of each reporting period, and are discounted (at a 
pre- tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability) to 
present value where the effect is material. provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
1.17 revenue recognition
1.17.1 net interest income
interest income is recognised using the effective interest 
method, taking into account the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate over the period to maturity. interest 
income is recognised in profit or loss for all financial assets 
measured at amortised cost and debt instruments measured 
at fvoci.
where financial assets have been impaired, interest income 
continues to be recognised on the impaired value, based on the 
original effective interest rate. interest income includes the 
amortisation of any discount or premium, or other differences 
between the initial carrying amount of an interest-bearing 
instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective 
interest basis.
interest income for all financial assets measured at fvpl is 
presented separately from interest income from financial assets 
measured at amortised cost and debt instruments measured 
at fvoci.

1.17.2 non-interest revenue
non-interest revenue consists of revenue from contracts with 
customers within the scope of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts 
with customers (ifrs 15) and non-interest revenue arising from 
financial instruments to which the sarb is party to. all non- 
interest revenue is included in operating income except where 
stated otherwise.
1.17.2.1 revenue from contracts with customers
for contracts within the scope of ifrs 15, the group 
recognises revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of 
promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the group expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those services.
revenue from contracts with customers comprises the 
following items:
settlement commission income
the sarb provides settlement services for both the national 
payment system (nps) and the southern african development 
community real-time gross settlement (sadc-rtgs). the 
performance obligation of the sarb is to receive and process 
settlement instructions on behalf of nps and sadc-rtgs 
participants. revenue is recognised at the point in time when 
the performance obligation has been satisfied i.e. settlement 
instruction has been executed.
bulk cash service fees
the sarb earns fees on banknote deposit and banknote 
withdrawal services provided to users of bulk cash services. 
the performance obligation of the sarb is the distinct service 
of accepting a deposit or performing a withdrawal of bulk cash. 
the consideration is variable depending on the number of notes 
being deposited or withdrawn and the penalties charged on the 
condition of the bank notes on deposit. the performance 
obligation is satisfied when the sarb has successfully 
processed a deposit or withdrawal. revenue is recognised at 
a point in time when the deposit or withdrawal is accepted.
bank charges
the sarb provides banking services to the sa government on 
a monthly basis and earns revenue in the form of bank charges. 
the performance obligations of the sarb is to provide banking 
services which include, but are not limited to electronic fund 
transfers, foreign and local payments and deposits from 
commercial banks. the performance obligations are satisfied 
when the sarb executes the specific transaction. the bank 
charges are recognised at a point in time when the service has 
been rendered.
sale of bank notes and coin
the sabn and the south african mint produce and sell 
banknotes and coin to the sarb and other third parties. 
the timing of revenue recognition is either at a point in time 
when (or as) the related performance obligations are satisfied by 
transferring the promised goods to customers.
management fees
the sarb receives management fees from the cpd, the sarb 
retirement fund, the sabn and the south african mint.
a fee is charged to the sabn and the south african mint for 
the secretariat support provided by the sarb group 
secretariat, which includes meeting facilitation, minute taking, 
circulation of resolutions, and fulfillment of certain legislative 
requirements in terms of legislation and overall governance 
services and support.
a fee is charged to the sarb retirement fund for the provision 
of consulting support services and administrative and 
accounting duties.
a fee is charged to the cpd for all the functions that the bank 
carries out for the cpd. the bank carries out all the cpd 
functions, as the cpd has no employees of its own.
these performance obligations are satisfied over time. the fees 
are payable monthly. revenue is recognised each month.
1.17.2.2 other income
other income relates to amounts received that are outside the 
scope of ifrs 15 and comprises of the following items:
license fees
annual license fees are fees charged by the sarb in accordance 
with legislation, to institutions that have been granted licenses 
to operate as a bank or as an insurance business. fees are 
charged on an annual basis on the date prescribed by 
legislation and are non-refundable. revenue is recognised 
immediately on the license fee date prescribed by legislation.
sundry income
sundry income relates mainly to recoveries of expenses 
previously incurred. these amounts are recognised as income 
when it is probable that the amount will be received.
1.18 dividends paid
in terms of the sarb act, the sarb is permitted to declare 
dividends from its accumulated profits. this is capped at a total 
dividend rate of 10% per annum on the paid-up share capital of 
the sarb.
1.19 related parties
as per ias 24 related party disclosures, the financial 
statements contain the disclosures necessary to draw attention 
to the possibility that the group’s financial position and profit or 
loss may have been affected by the existence of related parties 
and by transactions and outstanding balances with such 
parties.

governance in accordance with legislation, and members of 
management that are responsible for the strategic direction and 
operational management of the group and are entrusted with 
significant authority. their remuneration may be established by 
statute or by another body independent of the group. their 
responsibilities may enable them to influence the benefits of 
office that flow to them, their related parties or parties that they 
represent on the governing body.
1.20 share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity. incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of taxation, from the proceeds.
1.21 key accounting estimates and 
judgements
in preparing the group's financial statements, management 
applies judgement and makes estimates. estimates and 
judgements are reviewed on an on-going basis and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.
other than the items listed below, there were no significant 
changes to the group’s estimates and assumptions in the 
current or prior year.
1.21.1 fair value of financial instruments
financial instruments are priced with reference to quoted 
market prices in an actively traded market.
if the market for a financial asset is not active or an instrument 
is an unlisted instrument, the fair value is estimated using 
valuation techniques. these include reference to other 
instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash 
flow analysis and option-pricing models.
when a discounted cash flow analysis is used to determine the 
value of financial assets, estimated future cash flows are based 
on management’s best estimates, and the discount rate at the 
reporting date is a market-related rate for a financial asset with 
similar terms and conditions.
where option-pricing models are used, inputs based on 
observable market indicators at the reporting date are only 
recognised to the extent that they relate to changes in factors 
that market participants will consider in setting a price.
1.21.2 measurement of expected credit loss 
allowance
the measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for 
financial assets measured at amortised cost and fvoci is an 
area that requires complex models and significant assumptions 
about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g. the 
likelihood of counterparties defaulting and the resulting losses). 
explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation 
techniques used in measuring ecl is further detailed in note 
28.2.2 which also sets out key sensitivities of the ecl to 
changes in these elements.
a number of significant judgements are also required in applying 
the accounting requirements for measuring ecl, such as:
• determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk (sicr);
• choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the 
measurement of ecl;
• establishing the number and relative weightings of forward 
looking scenarios for each type of product or market and the 
associated ecl; and
• establishing groups of similar financial assets for the 
purposes of measuring ecl.
detailed information about the judgements and estimates made 
by the group in the above areas is set out in note 28.2.2.
1.21.3 fair value of unlisted investments
judgement is exercised in assessing the fair value of unlisted 
investments held by the group. a discounted cash flow analysis 
is used by the group to determine the value of its unlisted 
investments by applying an appropriate discount rate to the 
best estimate of future cash flows of the investee. the key 
assumptions applied in the discounted cash flow valuation 
method are the equity market risk premium, sa risk free rate, 
the alpha and beta to determine the overall discount rate. free 
cash flows for a period of 3-5 years are provided by the 
investee and further assessed by management. detailed 
information about the estimates made by the group in the 
above areas are set out in note 33.
1.21.4 post-employment benefits
the cost of the defined-benefit pension plans and other benefit 
plans and the present value of the benefit obligations are 
determined using actuarial valuations. an actuarial valuation 
involves using various assumptions determined by management 
and reviewed annually by the actuary that may differ from future 
developments.
these assumptions include:
• discount rates;
• inflation rates;
• rates of compensation increases;
• rates of pension increases;
• medical cost trends; and
• mortality rates.
statutory actuarial valuations are performed triennially with the 
31 march 2021 valuation having found the fund to be in a 
sound financial position. interim actuarial valuations are 
concluded annually (except in years where a statutory valuation 
is performed). the next statutory valuation will be performed 
within the 2024 calendar year.

1.21 key accounting estimates and 
judgements continued
1.21.5 inventory valuations
the group’s currency-producing subsidiaries measure inventory 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. the determination 
of net realisable value is an entity-specific estimate and requires 
the use of judgement.
1.21.6 property, plant and equipment
judgement is required when determining:
• the costs that are attributable to the asset;
• for assets where valuation is applied, the fair value of the 
valuable art;
• the appropriate useful life over which the assets should be 
depreciated or amortised;
• the depreciation method; and
• whether the existing assets are subject to impairment.
1.21.7 recognition of deferred tax assets
deferred taxation assets are recognised for unused taxation 
losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the losses can be utilised, which 
requires judgement. although the list is not exhaustive, the 
following was considered in determining the appropriateness 
of recognising deferred taxation assets:
• the group’s history of profitability.
• forecasts of future profits, incorporating forward-looking 
information.
• the group’s investment strategy in local and foreign markets.
• significant local and global events when appropriate, such as 
the impact of global interest rate hikes and the russia-
ukraine and israeli-palestinian conflict.
1.21.8 order of liquidity
as a financial institution, the group presents its assets and 
liabilities on the statement of financial position in order of 
liquidity. this provides information that is reliable and more 
relevant than a current or non-current presentation, because 
the entity does not supply goods or services within a clearly 
identifiable operating cycle.
the order of liquidity requires judgement, particularly in light of 
the nature of the sarb’s operations and mandate as the 
central bank of south africa. the sarb’s mandate regarding 
the management and oversight of the domestic financial market 
results in regular changes to the liquidity of the sarb assets 
and liabilities, in response to the liquidity requirements of the 
market. the sarb continuously monitors and actively manages 
its liquidity requirements.
1.22 leases
the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease, 
at the inception of the contract. a contract is, or contains a 
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
in certain circumstances the determination of whether the 
contract is or contains a lease requires significant judgement. 
in particular, the group has assessed that despite the sarb’s 
control of the sabn and the south african mint, the sarb 
cannot separately identify a lease with regard to the banknote 
and coin sales agreements.
group as lessee 
a lease liability and corresponding right of use asset are 
recognised at the lease commencement date, for all lease 
agreements for which the group is a lessee.
the various lease and non-lease components of contracts 
containing leases are accounted for separately, with 
consideration being allocated to each lease component on the 
basis of the relative stand-alone prices of the lease components 
and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease 
components (where non-lease components exist).
details of leasing arrangements where the group is a lessee are 
presented in note 12.
right of use assets
right of use assets are presented within property, plant and 
equipment on the consolidated and separate statement of 
financial position.
right of use assets are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of 
lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. however, if a 
lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of 
the right of use asset reflects that the group expects to 
exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is 
depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
depreciation starts at the commencement date of a lease.
for right of use assets which are depreciated over their useful 
lives, the useful lives are determined consistently with items of 
the same class of property, plant and equipment. refer to the 
accounting policy for property, plant and equipment for details 
of useful lives.
the residual value, useful life and depreciation method of each 
asset are reviewed at the end of each reporting year. if the 
expectations differ from previous estimates, the change is 
accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting 
estimate. each part of a right of use asset with a cost that is 
significant in relation to the total cost of the asset is depreciated 
separately.
the depreciation charge for each year is recognised in profit or 
loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.

margin entitlement and credit premium receivable
in terms of the lgs agreement, participating commercial banks are required to pay certain amounts described below to the margin

payable by commercial banks to sarb minus the cost of capital, statutory costs, and administration fees in respect of the covid-19 
loan, 0.50% thereof is the credit premium which gets transferred into the credit premium account.
as at 31 march 2024, an amount of r554 million (2023: r521 million) has been recognised with a corresponding provision for credit 
loss claims in other liabilities. refer to note 18 for more information.
margin entitlement and credit premium accounts accrue interest at the repo rate of the sarb and will be used to settle losses 
incurred by the commercial banks in terms of the lgs. thereafter, the losses are borne by the commercial banks up to the aggregate 
amount equal to the commercial banks' risk portion (being 6% of the aggregate amount advanced by the sarb against the facility 
amount). any losses remaining which have not been settled as aforementioned, shall be guaranteed and be borne by the sarb on 
the basis that the outstanding balance shall be reduced to equal the amount of such losses.

6.3 derivatives
the sarb utilises financial derivative products for portfolio management purposes, and seeks to minimise the effects of currency and 
interest rate risks by using such instruments to economically hedge the related risk exposures. the use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the sarb’s policies approved by the governors’ executive committee (gec), which provides written principles on the 
use of derivative financial instruments. compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by management on a continuous 
basis. risk management practices also include regular reporting to the risk management committee (rmc) and board risk and 
ethics committee (brec). the sarb does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for proprietary trading purposes.

loan guarantee scheme
the sarb entered into a loan guarantee scheme (lgs) with participating commercial banks for the purpose of assisting qualifying 
small and medium-sized businesses severely impacted during the covid-19 pandemic. drawdowns by qualifying businesses, under 
the lgs, were available for an 11-month period commencing from the effective date (moratorium period), which was extended by 
a further three months to july 2021. the outstanding balance at the end of the moratorium period is repayable over 60 months. 
a facility of r100 billion was approved, of which r89.6 billion was allocated to nine commercial banks.
the total outstanding balance (including interest) of r6.3 billion (2023: r9.3 billion) is guaranteed by the sarb. the guarantee is 
limited to the r6.3 billion allocated to the commercial banks. in turn national treasury has guaranteed the sarb for losses incurred 
under the scheme. due to the integral nature of the guarantee, it is taken into account in the ecl calculation. refer to note 32 for 
further details.
the loan accrues interest at the prevailing repo rate (2023: repo rate). any default interest that accrues as a result of the commercial 
banks failing to repay the sarb at the interest repayment date will be accounted for at the default interest rate of repo rate plus 2%.
at the reporting date none of the lgs loans were past due or impaired (2023: none). during the year under review, no defaults were 
experienced (2023: no defaults).
bounce back scheme
in april 2022, the bounce back scheme (bbs) was established to assist eligible small businesses to recover from the impact of 
covid-19, the recent floods and riots in the country. in terms of the scheme, the sarb advanced loans to participating commercial 
banks who advanced bounce back loans to eligible businesses. the sarb approved facilities of r1.2 billion, of which r262 million 
was not utilised at the end of the availability period for drawdowns on 30 april 2023.
the loan accrues interest at the prevailing repo rate (2023: repo rate). any default interest that accrues as a result of the commercial 
banks failing to repay the sarb at the interest repayment date will be accounted for at the default interest rate of repo rate plus 2%.
the sarb has issued a financial guarantee to the commercial banks under the facility, limited to 20.5% of the capital amount 
advanced. national treasury has guaranteed the sarb for losses incurred under the scheme up to an amount of r8.0 billion, limited 
to the amount advanced to the commercial banks. the guarantee is considered to be an integral part of the scheme therefore it is 
included in the determination of ecl. refer to note 32 for further details. at the reporting date none of the bbs loans were past due 
or impaired (2023: none). during the current financial year, no defaults were experienced (2023: no defaults).

the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the bis shares been carried at cost was r657.9 million 
(2023: r624.8 million).
the shares in the bis are held as part of the sarb’s function as a central bank and are thus long-standing in nature. shares are only 
transferable with the prior consent of the bis.
the sarb’s investment in the bis consists of 8 612 shares (2023: 8 612), which are carried at fvoci. the net asset value was 
adjusted by 30%. the haircut is consistent with the methodology applied by the bis and other central banks and is not subject to 
sensitivity. the adjusted net asset value of the shares are based on the xdr 1 of xdr 30 463 (2023: xdr 28 491).
refer to note 30 for further detail on the fair value hierarchy disclosures. changes in value due to foreign exchange movements are 
transferred to the gfecra. for the year ended 31 march 2024, a movement of r322 million (2023: r928 million) was transferred to 
the gfecra.
1 the xdr is a monetary unit of international reserve assets defined and maintained by the imf. the xdr also serves as the unit of account of the bis, among other 
international organisations. the unit does not represent a currency, but represents a potential claim on the currencies of the imf members for which it may be exchanged. 
it is based on a basket of international currencies comprising the united states dollar, euro, japanese yen, pound sterling and chinese renminbi.

leased assets
included in property, plant and equipment are right of use assets with a carrying amount of r23 million (2023: r41 million) relating to 
the lease of office buildings by the sarb. the lease term is for 3 years, ending on 30 june 2025. there is no lease liability in respect 
of this lease as the total rentals amounting to r55 million were paid upfront in the 2022/23 financial year, before the commencement 
of the lease. in the current financial year, additional parking space was included in the lease, which may also be used until 
30 june 2025 and the total rentals for the parking space, amounting to r2 million, were also paid upfront. there are no variable 
lease payments applicable to this lease. the right of use asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term and 
depreciation of r15 million (2023: r14 million) was recognised for this lease in the current financial year.
revaluations
the group's valuable art is stated at revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. revaluations are performed by independent, reliable valuators every 
three years. in the absence of an official fair value assessment by an independent valuator, the insured value will be used as an 
indicator of fair value.
the fair value measurements as of 31 december 2021 were performed by the valuator advisory (pty) ltd, independent valuers not 
related to the group. the valuator advisory (pty) ltd is a member of the international fine arts and antiques appraisers association 
and the royal institute of chartered surveyors and the valuators have the appropriate qualifications and recent experience in the fair 
value measurement of fine arts and antiques. the next valuation is scheduled for 31 december 2024.
refer to note 30 for specific details regarding the valuation of the art.
the carrying value of the revalued assets under the cost model would have been:

banks’ reserve accounts
commercial banks are required to maintain a minimum cash reserve balance with the sarb into which they are able to deposit 
at least such amounts as may be necessary to comply with the sarb act. the banks’ reserve accounts do not accrue interest. 
in addition, the commercial banks can utilise the cash reserve accounts to either fund short positions or deposit surplus funds. 
as at year-end, the balance was below the required minimum reserve balance by an amount of r0.9 billion (2023: r0.1 billion). 
the commercial banks concerned are afforded an opportunity, subject to conditions as the governor may determine, to comply 
with the relevant provision within a specified period.
sa government accounts
the imf allocates special drawing rights to member countries based on the member's imf quota shares. sa government accounts 
is the allocation received on behalf of and payable to sa government.
call deposits
in terms of the current interest rate policies approved by the cpd board, call deposits earn interest at the repo rate (2023: repo rate 
plus 0.15%). the prevailing rate at year-end for call deposits was 8.40% (2023: 7.90%). margin call deposits are held on behalf of 
participants of the johannesburg stock exchange bond electronic trading platform. the sarb does not trade on the platform, but 
rather holds the deposits for participants of the platform. the margin call deposits earn interest at the repo rate (2023: repo rate less 
0.15%). the prevailing rate at year-end for margin call deposits was 8.25% (2023: 7.60%).

19.3 post-employment retirement fund benefits
the group has made provision for pension and provident plans substantially covering all employees. all employees are members of 
the retirement fund administered by the group or are members of funds within the various industries in which they are employed. 
the assets of these plans are held in administered trust funds separate from the group’s assets and the funds are governed by the 
pension funds act 24 of 1956.
statutory actuarial valuations are performed triennially with the 31 march 2021 valuation having found the fund to be in a sound 
financial position. interim actuarial valuations are concluded annually (except in years where a statutory valuation is performed), where 
a surplus in the fund is calculated, it is for the benefit of the members, and accordingly no asset is recognised in the financial 
statements of the sarb. the retirement fund is regulated by the financial sector conduct authority and is a single scheme which 
caters for active members, pensioners on a living annuity, pensioners on a life annuity, and pensioners from the former defined benefit 
fund.
active members participate on a defined contribution basis. the market risk lies fully with the active members until retirement. 
on retirement, former employees can commute up to one-third of their share of funds. they may use the remaining funds to buy 
either a living annuity or a life annuity (or a combination of both) from the fund. they may also choose to transfer their share of funds 
to another registered retirement annuity. 
living annuity pensioners bear the entire market risk on their funds; however, they also fully benefit from positive market returns.

19.3 post-employment retirement fund benefits continued
the life pension quoted by the retirement fund is based on the amount of capital available to the employee, as well as marital status, 
gender and age. as at 31 march 2024, there were 1 253 life pensioners (2023: 1 227 life pensioners). once quoted a life pension, the 
rules of the fund stipulate that it will not be reduced, and thus, although the pensioner bears the market risk with regard to the annual 
increase granted, the employer will contribute if there is a shortage in the pension account which supports maintaining pensions at 
their existing level. this is in effect the only uncovered ‘defined benefit’ element in the fund. the risk for the retirement fund, and 
ultimately the sarb, in meeting this defined benefit, is market risk and life expectancy. as the sarb is the sponsor of the fund, 
the full defined benefit liability resides within the sarb. an ias 19 employee benefits (ias 19) valuation of this defined benefit at 
31 march 2024 was performed by an independent actuary, the result of which can be summarised as follows:

management does not use the ias 19 valuation in order to assess the health of the fund, nor as a base to inform management 
decisions with regard to the fund. management utilises the interim and statutory actuarial valuations for such purposes due to the fact 
that these actuarial valuations recognise that the pensioner bears the market risk of future pension increases and the discount rate 
applied reflects the risk profile of the assets in which the fund is invested.

19.3 post-employment retirement fund benefits continued
the assets and liabilities of the defined benefit fund, which has been closed to new members since 1 july 1995, were transferred 
to the retirement fund on 31 march 2011. as at 31 march 2024, 127 pensioners (2023: 143 pensioners) qualify for the defined 
benefits. the benefits provided are based on the individual’s years of membership and salary levels. these benefits were provided 
from contributions made by employees and the employer, and income derived from assets of the plan. the actuarial risk in respect 
of current pension commitments has mainly been transferred to sanlam, which has a credit rating of aa (standard and poor’s), no 
further financial disclosures are deemed necessary in respect of the defined benefit, as required by ias 19. the actuarial liability 
as at 31 march 2024 amounted to r98 million (2023: r108 million), while the plan assets towards this liability in 2024 amounted to 
r98 million (2023: r108 million).
since inception in 1995, there has not been a shortage in the pension account for any given year. the most recent statutory valuation 
at 31 march 2021 found the fund to be fully funded, with the actuarial liability of pensions to be r3 billion (2018: r2 billion) with plan 
assets of r3 billion (2018: r2 billion). the trustees of the retirement fund and the management of the sarb do not foresee a statutory 
liability for the sarb in terms of these pensioners.
the plan assets were invested in the following different asset classes as at 31 march 2024 per the actuarial valuation:
local equities 24%
local property 2%
local fixed interest 34%
cash 7%
foreign investments 26%

27.1 codi operations and guarantee
on 1 april 2024 the relevant provisions of the financial sector regulation act no. 9 of 2017 (fsr act) and the secondary legislation 
for codi, governing the operations of codi became effective. from this date the depositors of member banks were covered and 
codi was able to start charging annual levies and monthly premiums to the member banks.
the sarb has issued a guarantee to commercial banks for loan amounts provided to codi for the liquidity tier of the deposit 
insurance fund (dif), effective from 1 april 2024. member banks are required to maintain a loan amount of 3% of their covered 
deposits’ balance with codi for as long as they are licenced. the loan will be repaid by codi as the entity accumulates sufficient 
liquidity in the dif.
the sarb has committed to provide codi with an emergency funding loan, in the event that codi is unable to meet its obligations 
as specified in section 166aa of the fsr act. the total amount of the emergency funding loan will be mutually agreed upon by both 
parties when codi makes a request for the loan.
27.2 energy bounce back scheme
in april and may 2024, a total of r203 million was advanced on the energy bounce back loan scheme. refer to note 32 for details 
on the scheme.
27.3 gfecra settlement framework
in june 2024, the sarb concluded a settlement framework agreement with the national treasury for the settlement of the gfecra 
liability. in terms of the agreement, the sarb will settle r250 billion of the gfecra liability in installments over the next 3 financial 
years. the national treasury will transfer r100 billion to the sarb in the 2024/25 financial year, to promote the policy solvency of the 
sarb. further settlement of the gfecra liability may only occur if the sarb has an adequate contingency reserve level as well as an 
adequate estimated gfecra balance level to absorb potential future currency reversals.

28. risk management in respect of financial instruments
 introduction
the sarb is a risk-averse institution. owing to the unique role and functions of the sarb, risk management is not solely based on 
risk and return considerations but also takes into account public interest in line with the statutory and constitutional responsibility of 
the sarb.
the sarb holds and manages the official reserves of the republic of south africa in accordance with its role as a central bank and 
the sarb act. the sarb is also responsible for achieving and maintaining price stability in the interest of sustainable and balanced 
economic development and growth through the monetary policy. the sarb carefully considers the sensitivity of particular risk 
management disclosures , in relation to its role and activities as a central bank. therefore, not all information as required by 
ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures is disclosed. refer to the financial reporting framework on for details on excluded 
disclosures.
the financial markets department (fmd) of the sarb is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy and the management 
of the reserves.
reserves management
reserves play a key role in ensuring that the country will be able to:
• cover its external operational needs;
• service the country’s foreign exchange liabilities;
• cover any foreign currency net imbalances in the balance of payments; and
• maintain confidence in the country’s monetary and exchange rate policies.
framework
the risk tolerance of the sarb, as far as reserves management operations are concerned, is specified and implemented through the 
investment policy (ip), the strategic asset allocation (saa), the active risk budget and the investment guidelines. the ip provides a 
strategic framework that guides fmd and the reserves management committee (resmanco) in their respective roles in the reserves 
management process. the ip specifies, among other things, the aggregate tolerance parameters of the sarb and the eligible asset 
classes, which are implemented through the saa.
the saa determines the optimal asset allocation, while recognising the risk tolerance and liquidity constraints of the sarb. it sets the 
tranche sizes, currency composition, appropriate asset classes and calculates the expected risk and return over the relevant time 
horizon. these parameters are specified at tranche level. hence, each tranche has its own asset mix aimed at achieving the 
investment objectives of the tranche. the investment objectives in order of priority are:
• capital preservation;
• liquidity; and
• achieving reasonable returns.
governance
the sarb has a three-tier governance structure where the responsibilities for executive authority, strategic management and the 
actual portfolio management are clearly segregated. this comprises of the gec, resmanco and fmd. the gec is responsible for 
decision making around the overall risk tolerance of the organisation, the ip and the saa of reserves. the resmanco is the investment 
committee which functions within the parameters defined by the gec, and is responsible for decision making around investment 
guidelines, the allocation of the active risk budget to individual portfolios and the appointment or removal of external fund managers 
and custodians.
risk reporting is a formalised and clearly defined process within the is compiled and distributed to senior 
management of the , which focuses on the 
management of risks relating to foreign exchange reserves, is distributed to the resmanco and the gec. moreover, a quarterly 
financial risk report is compiled and distributed to members of the s is 
to inform management of financial risk to which the sarb may be exposed, the possible impact on the key functions of the sarb, 
and how such risks are managed. the report, furthermore, highlights future risks that might adversely impact on the activities of the 
s are market, credit and operational risk in 
relation to market, monetary policy implementation and reserves management operations.
risk governance policies and procedures are performed by heads of departments, managing directors of the subsidiaries, and the 
risk management and compliance department with oversight by the rmc and brec. certain aspects of risk management specific 
to financial instruments are described below.

reserves management continued
daily operations
reserves management activities are performed by fmd. these activities are in line with principles of sound internal governance which 
include that of portfolio management, performance measurement, risk control and compliance, accounting and settlement.
statement of financial position impact
key statement of financial position balances related to reserves management include:
note 11 – equity investment in bis;
note 6 – gold and foreign exchange reserves; and 
note 20 – gfecra.
monetary policy
the task of implementing monetary policy decisions is undertaken through a range of refinancing operations conducted with the 
commercial banks as counterparties and which are executed at or with a spread to the repo (policy) rate. in addition to the refinancing 
operations, fmd also conducts a range of open market operations to influence the liquidity in the money market. market operations 
are undertaken in both the domestic and foreign exchange markets. the open market operations include the issuance of sarb 
debentures, reverse repos, the movement of public sector funds between the market and the sarb and the conducting of money 
market swaps in the foreign exchange market.
in addition to the main repo facility, the sarb offers a range of end-of-day facilities for the commercial banks to square-off the daily 
positions on their settlement accounts, e.g. access to their cash reserve balances held with the sarb, supplementary repos/reverse 
repos conducted at the repo rate and an automated standing facility whereby the end-of-day balances on the banks’ settlement 
accounts are automatically settled at a rate of 1.00% below or above the policy rate.
framework
the framework for domestic market operations is specified in the operational notice.
governance
the sarb has full operational autonomy. monetary policy is set by the sarb’s monetary policy committee (mpc), which conducts 
monetary policy within a flexible inflation-targeting framework. this committee consists of seven members of the sarb: the governor, 
three deputy governors and three senior officials of the sarb.
daily operations
the domestic market operations section (within fmd) is responsible for the conducting of all domestic market operations associated 
with the sarb’s responsibility for monetary policy implementation. these operations entail all the liquidity providing and liquidity 
draining operations conducted with banking counterparties.
statement of financial position impact 
key statement of financial position balances related to monetary policy implementation include: 
note 3 – accommodation to banks and standing facilities;
note 8 – fec assets and liabilities; 
note 15 – notes and coin in circulation;
note 16 – banks’ reserve and current accounts; 
note 16 – sa government special deposit; and

28. risk management in respect of financial instruments continued
28.1 market risk
market risk monitoring is conducted at all levels (e.g. portfolio and tranche level) with constant tracking of the risk metrics such as 
duration, ‘value at risk’ and ‘tracking error’. portfolio holdings data is consolidated and stress testing and scenario analyses are 
conducted in the portfolios to ensure that risk exposures remain within the approved risk tolerance levels should extreme market 
movements occur. in the event that the risk metrics deviate significantly from the approved levels, recommendations to review or 
amend the necessary allocations may be escalated to resmanco. market risk is reported on a daily, monthly and quarterly basis.
28.1.1 interest rate risk
with the exception of sa government bonds and amounts due by/to related parties, the rand-denominated financial assets and 
liabilities of the sarb respectively earn and bear interest at rates linked to south african money market rates. the level of these rates 
is closely linked to the sarb’s repo rate, which is set by the mpc. the repricing of these assets and liabilities therefore occurs at 
approximately the same time as changes to the repo rate are announced by the mpc.
the sarb is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of its foreign investments. the risk tolerance and return expectations in respect 
of these financial instruments are embodied in the saa, which is approved by the gec. the risk budget is approved by the gec.
28.1.2 price risk
assets used as collateral (refer to note 3) are subject to a daily mark-to-market valuation. in order to protect the sarb against credit 
and market risk, participants in the repo agreement transactions have to provide securities representing market values in excess of the 
exposures (‘haircut valuations’). the ‘haircut’ is the extent to which the collateral must exceed the value of the underlying loan 
(e.g. 102.00%). the excess collateral value is to protect against the risk embedded in the assets used as collateral. treasury bills 
and sarb debentures are valued at the most recent auction’s discount rates.
28.1.3 currency risk
foreign exchange operations
the framework of control regarding market operations in foreign exchange, that is, in spot and forward foreign exchange transactions, 
is rigorous. trading limits exist for these instruments and compliance is monitored and reported daily. foreign exchange risk is 
managed by approving certain currencies for the foreign exchange reserve portfolios to diversify this risk. the gains and losses 
resulting from active risk positions are recorded in the sarb’s statement of comprehensive income. gains and losses arising from 
movements in the exchange rate of the rand are recorded in gfecra in the sarb’s statement of financial position. the sarb’s 
exposure to currency risk from holding reserves is thus limited by the fact that, in terms of the sarb act, all profits or losses on gold, 
foreign exchange adjustments on assets and liabilities, and on any current or future fec shall be for the account of the sa government.

concentration risk 
concentration risk is the risk of significant exposure to a single counterparty or geographic region. concentration risk is calculated on the basis of a percentage of the 
exposure to the counterparty of the sarb as a percentage of total exposures to all counterparties. this is actively monitored by the risk management unit (within fmd).

28.2 credit risk
credit risk is the risk of loss due to the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. credit risk 
arises from activities of the group such as cash and cash equivalents, accommodation to banks, loans and advances, loan 
commitments arising from such lending activities, other financial assets such as trade receivables, but can also arise from credit 
enhancement provided, such as financial guarantees. the group is also exposed to other credit risks arising from investments in 
debt securities and other exposures arising from its trading activities including non-equity trading portfolio assets and derivatives as 
well as settlement balances with market counterparties and reverse repo agreements.
a prudent approach to credit risk management is adopted through limiting investment activities to high credit quality assets and 
counterparties by setting minimum credit rating requirements and requesting appropriate collateral. credit risk is largely managed 
by specifying concentration and holding limits per asset class, counterparty or issuer type and credit rating category in the 
investment guidelines. the sarb mitigates concentration risk through diversification and investing in accordance with the 
prescriptions of the investment guidelines. this excludes government owned entities and guaranteed securities of highly rated 
countries. exposure to these entities are usually unlimited as credit risk is perceived to be minimal. furthermore, minimum collateral 
requirements and netting-off arrangements with certain counterparties and securities lending agents are in place, usually through 
the master international swaps and derivatives association agreements. in addition, the use of exchange traded derivatives, legally 
segregated custodial and securities lending accounts and indemnity arrangements further mitigate counterparty pre-settlement, 
settlement and replacement risks. credit risk is reported on a daily, monthly and quarterly basis.
credit risk exposure monitoring is conducted at all levels (e.g. portfolio and issuer level). portfolio holdings data is consolidated and 
exposure concentration is monitored at counterparty, asset class, issuer type and credit rating category levels. through constant 
monitoring of market information, together with in depth financial statement analysis of counterparties, where necessary, the 
appropriate recommendations to review or amend credit and concentration limits are escalated to resmanco and the gec.
28.2.1 credit risk measurement
the estimation of credit exposure for risk management purposes is complex and requires the use of models, as the exposure varies 
with changes in market conditions, expected cash flows and the passage of time. the assessment of credit risk of a portfolio of 
assets entails further estimations as to the likelihood of defaults occurring, of the associated loss ratios and of default correlations. 
the group measures credit risk using pd, ead and lgd for financial assets classified as at amortised cost. this is similar to the 
approach used for the purposes of measuring ecl under ifrs 9. refer to note 28.2.2 for more details.
the group uses external credit risk gradings that reflect its assessment of the pd of individual counterparties. the group uses rating 
models tailored to the various categories of counterparties. borrower and loan specific information collected at the time of application 
(such as level of collateral) is fed into this rating model. this is supplemented with external data such as credit bureau scoring 
information on individual borrowers. in addition, the models enable judgement to be fed into the final internal credit rating for each 
exposure. this allows for considerations which may not be captured as part of the other data inputs into the model. the credit grades 
are calibrated such that the risk of default increases exponentially at each higher risk grade. for example, this means that the 
difference in the pd between an a and a- rating grade is lower than the difference in the pd between a b and b- rating grade.
the following are additional considerations for each type of portfolio held by the group:
• for debt securities in accommodation to banks, short-term deposits and loans and advances, external rating agency credit grades 
are used. these published grades are continuously monitored and updated. the pds associated with each grade are determined 
based on realised default rates over the prior 12 months, as published by the rating agency.
• the group’s rating method comprises 25 rating levels for instruments not in default (1 to 25) and five default classes (26 to 30). 
the master scale assigns each rating category a specified range of probabilities of default, which is stable over time. the rating 
methods are subject to an annual validation and recalibration so that they reflect the latest projections in the light of all actually 
observed defaults.

28.2.2 ecl measurement
ifrs 9 outlines a ‘three-stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition. the group applies the 
same model for all financial assets and is summarised below:
• a financial instrument that is not credit-impaired on initial recognition is classified in ‘stage 1’ and has its credit risk continuously 
monitored by the group.
• if a sicr since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to ‘stage 2’ but is not yet deemed to be credit-
impaired. please refer to note 28.2.2.1 for a description of how the group determines when a sicr has occurred.
• if the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument is then moved to ‘stage 3’. please refer to note 28.2.2.2 for a 
description of how the group defines credit-impaired and default.
• financial instruments in stage 1 have their ecl measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ecl that result from default 
events possible within the next 12 months. financial instruments in stages 2 or 3 have their ecl measured based on ecl on a 
lifetime basis. please refer to note 28.2.2.3 for a description of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring 
the ecl.
• a pervasive concept in measuring ecl in accordance with ifrs 9 is that it should consider forward-looking information. 
note 28.2.2.4 includes an explanation of how the group has incorporated this in its ecl models.
• purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets are those financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. 
their ecl is always measured on a lifetime basis (stage 3).
the key judgements and assumptions adopted by the group in addressing the requirements of the standard are discussed below:
28.2.2.1 significant increase in credit risk
the group considers a financial instrument to have experienced a sicr when one or more of the following quantitative, qualitative 
or backstop criteria have been met:
quantitative criteria:
the sarb uses credit ratings in order to determine the sicr. the movement of an asset’s credit rating to the next lower rating of the 
credit rating scale is defined as a 1 notch rating movement (i.e. moving from a+ to a). the sicr for the sarb is defined as a rating 
change of more than 2 notches as this change is guaranteed to move the asset to the next rating category or risk profile. therefore a 
3 notch rating movement will always guarantee a movement of a financial asset to the next rating category (i.e. (i) upper medium 
grade to lower medium grade, (ii) non-investment grade to highly speculative grade, (iii) substantial risks to extremely speculative) 
which according to the rating scale is of lower credit worthiness and this is applicable in all grades of the credit rating scale. the 
short-term nature of exposure makes it unlikely that credit risk will move significantly. this is however reviewed frequently.
sicr is considered before contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, and thus the rebuttable presumption that the credit 
risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past 
due does not apply. when the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments, it is considered credit-impaired.

28.2.2 ecl measurement continued 
28.2.2.1 significant increase in credit risk continued
qualitative criteria:
if the borrower is on the watch list and/or the instrument meets one or more of the following criteria:
• negative outlook by two or more rating agencies in the past six months.
• significant adverse changes in business, financial and/or economic conditions in which the borrower operates.
• actual or expected forbearance or restructuring.
• actual or expected significant adverse change in operating results of the borrower.
• significant change in collateral value (secured facilities only) which is expected to increase risk of default.
• early signs of cash flow/liquidity problems such as delay in servicing of trade creditors/loans.
the group has not used the low credit risk exemption for any financial instruments in the year ended 31 march 2024 (2023: none).
28.2.2.2 definition of default and credit-impaired assets
the group defines a financial instrument as in default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-impaired, when it meets one or 
more of the following criteria:
quantitative criteria:
the borrower is more than 30 days past due on its contractual payments.
qualitative criteria:
the borrower meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the borrower is in significant financial difficulty. these are instances 
where:
• the borrower is in long-term forbearance.
• the borrower is in breach of financial covenant(s) if applicable.
• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy.
• financial assets are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.
• an active market for that financial asset has disappeared.
the criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the group and are consistent with the definition of default 
used for internal credit risk management purposes. the default definition has been applied consistently to model the pd, ead and 
lgd throughout the group’s expected loss calculations.
an instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e. to have cured) when it no longer meets any of the default criteria for a 
consecutive period of three months. this period of three months has been determined based on an analysis which considers the 
likelihood of a financial instrument returning to default status after cure using different possible cure definitions.

28.2.2 ecl measurement continued
28.2.2.3 measuring ecl – explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques
the ecl is measured on either a 12-month (12m) or lifetime basis depending on whether a sicr has occurred since initial 
recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit-impaired. the general formulation of the ecl determination under the 
components-based approach (i.e. a model based on pd, ead and lgd) requires the derivation of term structured pd, ead and lgd 
parameters as well as original effective interest rate for discounting. ecl calculations using this approach are based on the following 
components:
• pd – this is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.
• ead – this is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the 
reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, and expected drawdowns on committed facilities.
• lgd – this is an estimate of the loss arising on default. it is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and 
those that the lender would expect to receive, including from any collateral. it is usually expressed as a percentage of the ead.
• period of exposure – expected period of exposure to credit risk not mitigated by risk management actions for instruments which 
include both drawn and undrawn parts.
• discount rate – this is used to discount the expected loss to a present value at the reporting date using the effective interest rate 
(eir) at initial recognition. the eir is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a 
financial liability.
the 12m and lifetime eads are determined based on the expected payment profile, which varies by instrument.
• for amortising products and bullet repayment loans, this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 
12m or lifetime basis. the 12m and lifetime lgds are determined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made post 
default. these vary by product type.
• for secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, historical discounts to market/book 
values due to forced sales, time to repossession and recovery costs observed.
• for unsecured products, lgds are typically set at product level due to the limited differentiation in recoveries achieved across 
different borrowers.
forward-looking economic information is also included in determining the 12m and lifetime pd, ead and lgd. refer to note 
28.2.2.4 for an explanation of forward- looking information and its inclusion in ecl calculations.
the assumptions underlying the ecl calculation (such as how the maturity profile of the pds and how collateral values change etc.) 
are monitored and reviewed periodically.
there have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or assumptions used during the reporting period (2023: none).
28.2.2.4 forward-looking information incorporated in the ecl models
forward-looking information is incorporated into each of the model’s scenarios, i.e. the base, upside and downside scenarios.
periodically, stress testing is carried out of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of the upside and downside 
representative scenarios. a comprehensive review is performed at least annually on the design of the scenarios by a panel of experts 
that advises senior management.

the group writes off financial assets when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery. indicators thereof include ceasing enforcement activity or where the collateral value indicates 
that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.

28.2.3.2 collateral and other credit enhancements
the group employs a range of policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. the most common of these is accepting collateral for 
funds advanced. the group has internal policies on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral or credit risk mitigation.
credit risk with respect to monetary policy operations is sufficiently mitigated, since all repo transactions are fully collateralised. 
furthermore, in terms of the sarb act, no unsecured lending is allowed with the exception of loans made to sa government, 
subsidiaries of the sarb and certain staff loans. the list of eligible securities is specified in the operational notice published on 
the sarb’s website. furthermore, operations in the foreign exchange market can only be conducted with authorised dealers.
the minimum counterparty credit rating for placing deposits and investing in sa government bonds is ‘a’ by standard & poor’s 
or its moody’s or fitch rating equivalents, while the minimum rating for investments in corporate bonds is ‘aa-’.
there were no investment securities with a credit rating below the sarb’s investment guidelines as at 31 march 2024 (2023: none).
the group’s policies regarding obtaining collateral have not significantly changed during the reporting period, excluding certain 
counterparty bills that the sarb has taken a decision to temporarily suspend as eligible collateral in its repo operations. there has 
been no significant change in the overall quality of the collateral held by the group since the prior period.
28.2.4 loss allowance
the loss allowance recognised in the period is impacted by a variety of factors, as described below:
• impact on the measurement of ecl due to changes in pds, eads and lgds in the period, arising from regular review of inputs.
• impacts on the measurement of ecl due to changes made to models and assumptions such as the estimated term of the facility.
• impact of updated legal agreements on the igcc facility refer to note 9.
as at 31 march 2024 the group recognised a loss allowance reversal of r337 million (2023: r38.0 million); sarb loss allowance 
reversal of r8 million (2023: r16 million).

28.3 liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that an entity may not be able to accommodate decreases in liabilities or fund increases in assets in full at the 
time that a commitment or transaction is due for settlement. in the case of the sarb, this risk is not relevant to domestic assets and 
liabilities because of the sarb’s ability to create rands when required. however, the sarb does face liquidity risk in respect of foreign 
assets and liabilities. the sarb manages its foreign liquidity risks through appropriate structuring of its foreign investment portfolios to 
ensure that the maturity profiles of foreign assets adequately match those of foreign commitments. this is monitored and managed on 
a daily basis by the fmd. in addition, liquidity risk is managed by setting requirements that ensure minimum standards of liquidity, 
which may include minimum issue size thresholds and securities must be liquid enough to ensure that they are sellable within a 
reasonably short period. moreover, the sarb’s reserve portfolios are constructed in such a way as to ensure that the ‘liquidity 
tranche’ is invested in relatively short-term securities in order to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet obligations.
the table below analyses the financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to 
contractual maturity date.

28.4 settlement risk
settlement risk (the risk that the counterparty may not be able to complete a transaction) is mitigated in a number of ways. the sarb 
will only transfer funds after sufficient collateral has been secured.
for outright transactions in securities, settlement risk is eliminated through the use of systems that are based on delivery versus 
payment, that is, the simultaneous exchange of securities and cash. in addition to restricting foreign exchange transactions to highly 
rated counterparties, a transaction limit is imposed on the total value of foreign currency transactions settling with a counterparty on a 
given day. furthermore, the sarb is a participant in continuous linked settlement, a clearing house that eliminates settlement risk in 
foreign exchange, allowing payment versus delivery in a number of major currencies. it eliminates ‘temporal’ settlement risk, making 
same-day settlement both possible and final.

30. fair value hierarchy disclosures
the tables below analyses the assets and liabilities of the group carried at fair value and amortised cost by the level of fair value 
hierarchy. the fair value hierarchy depends on the extent to which quoted prices are used in determining the fair value of the specific 
instruments. the different levels are defined as follows:
level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. these are readily available 
in the market and are normally obtainable from multiple sources.
level 2: fair value is based on input other than quoted prices included within level 1 that is observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
level 3: fair value is based on input for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).
the group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels as at the date of the event or 
change in circumstances that caused the transfer. during the year under review, there were no transfers between any of the levels 
(2023: none).
30.1 valuation techniques used to derive level 1 fair values
the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices as obtained from the custodians 
at the statement of financial position date. a market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an 
exchange, dealer broker or pricing services, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an 
arm’s-length basis. the quoted market price used for financial assets held by the sarb is the current price as per the custodian’s 
pricing hierarchy. these instruments are included in level 1.
30.2 valuation techniques used to derive level 2 fair values
the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined 
by using valuation techniques. these valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 
as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the 
instrument is included in level 2.
specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include the following:
• quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for gold and foreign exchange and investments;
• the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable 
yield curves;
• the fair value of fecs is determined using forward exchange rates at the statement of financial position date, with the resulting value 
discounted back to present value; and
• the fair value of all other instruments are derived with reference to yields.
30.3 valuation techniques used to derive level 3 fair values
the equity investment in the bis is classified as level 3. it is valued at the net asset value adjusted by 30%. this adjustment is not 
subject to sensitivity. the adjusted net asset value of the shares is based on sdrs. no active market exists for these shares. refer to 
note 11 for more detail.
the revaluation of valuable art is classified as level 3. revaluations will be performed every three years by independent, reliable 
valuators. in the absence of an official fair value assessment by an independent valuator the insured value will be used as an indicator 
of fair value. these fair value adjustments are not subject to sensitivity. refer to note 12 for more detail.

32. commitments and guarantees
32.1 energy bounce back scheme
in may 2023, the energy bounce back scheme (ebbs) was established to alleviate the impact of sustained loadshedding on small 
and medium enterprises and households. in terms of the scheme, the sarb will advance loans to commercial banks who advanced 
energy bounce back loans to eligible businesses and households. the sarb-approved facilities of r11.6 billion remained undrawn at 
31 march 2024. the sarb also issued a guarantee to the commercial banks in respect of losses incurred under the scheme. 
the sarb guarantee is limited to 20.5% of the total capital amount advanced to the commercial banks. in turn, in may 2023 the 
sa government issued a guarantee of up to r8 billion in favour of the sarb, to compensate for losses which may be incurred by 
the sarb in respect of the ebbs. the commercial banks indicated their intention to participate in the scheme by 31 march 2024. 
each participating commercial bank may drawdown on the facility for a period of 18 months from the signature date of their 
respective agreements.
32.2 loan guarantee scheme
in may 2020, the sarb entered into a lgs with various participating banks to provide funding to assist businesses to recover from the 
impact of covid-19. the sarb provided a guarantee to the commercial banks in respect of the covid-19 lgs to the extent of the 
current exposure of r6.2 billion (2023: r9.3 billion). the participating banks may claim losses under the scheme subject to a waterfall 
arrangement. a claim under the sarb guarantee is only possible after the participating banks exhaust the margin entitlement account, 
the credit premium account and the borrowers risk portion. in turn, the sa government issued a guarantee of r100 billion, in favour of 
the sarb in respect of any losses which may be incurred by the sarb in respect of the covid-19 lgs. the government reduced this 
guarantee from r100 billion to r12 billion in april 2022.
32.3 bounce back scheme
in april 2022, the bounce back scheme (bbs) was established to assist eligible small businesses to recover from the impact of 
covid-19, the recent floods and riots in certain parts of the country. in terms of the scheme, the sarb advanced loans to 
commercial banks who advanced bounce back loans to eligible businesses. the sarb approved facilities of r1.2 billion, of which 
r960 million was utilised. the availability period for drawdowns ended on 30 april 2024. the sarb also issued a guarantee to the 
commercial banks in respect of losses incurred under the scheme. the sarb guarantee is limited to 20.5% of the total capital 
amount advanced to the commercial banks. in turn, the sa government issued a guarantee of up to r8 billion in favour of the sarb, 
to compensate for losses which may be incurred by the sarb in respect of the bbs. in may 2023, the sa government reduced the 
guarantee of r8 billion to equal the bbs loans advanced of r938 million, to the extent of the current exposure of r812 million.
32.4 cpd guarantee
in june 2020, the sarb provided a guarantee of r3.5 billion to the cpd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the sarb, in order to cover 
the cpd for the impact of significant expected credit losses recognised, following the downgrade of the sovereign, as well as losses 
related to defaults by a certain counterparty and associated impairments recognised for the financial year. due to the technical 
insolvency of the cpd, the guarantee has been renewed annually, with the guarantee amount being adjusted in line with the 
accumulated losses of the cpd. the cpd has since recovered from technical insolvency and the existing guarantee of r800 million, 
expiring in june 2024 will not be renewed.
32.5 codi guarantee
the sarb issued a guarantee to commercial banks for loan amounts provided to codi for the liquidity tier of the deposit insurance 
fund, effective from 1 april 2024. this will allow banks to recognise the guarantee in the risk-weighting of these assets for regulatory 
capital purposes. member banks will have to maintain a loan amount of 3% of their covered deposits’ balance with the codi for as 
long as they are licenced.

32.6 restricted-use committed liquidity facility
in january 2024, the sarb approved a restricted-use committed liquidity facility of r15 billion to commercial banks effective from 
1 february 2024. the facility is intended to assist commercial banks to manage compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio required 
by basel iii and must be used for liquidity management purposes. any drawdowns on the facility will be repayable within 31 days, at 
an interest rate of repo plus 1%. the facility was undrawn as at 31 march 2024.
32.7 inter-governmental cash co-ordination
loans are advanced by the cpd as part of the national government’s inter-governmental cash co-ordination (igcc) arrangement, in 
terms of which some state-owned entities and treasuries of provincial governments deposit excess funds with the cpd to form a pool 
of funds from the public sector. the national and the provincial treasuries are allowed to borrow money from the igcc pool of funds. 
the sa government guarantees that the deposits will be made available to depositors on demand. 
the igcc loans are unsecured, short-term in nature and callable on demand. the loans earn interest at a repo plus 0.10%, which 
was 8.35% (2023: repo plus 0.25% which was 8%) at the reporting date. as at 31 march 2024, the igcc loan balance was rnil 
(2023: rnil).
the cpd and the sarb concluded updated igcc legal agreements with national treasury and the provincial treasuries effective from 
31 march 2024. the updated agreements clarify repayment terms for the facility and outlines the procedures in the event of default.
the agreements further clarify that the cpd and sarb are administrative parties in the igcc arrangement and will not be liable for 
any losses on the facility. as a result, the ecl allowance for the current financial year excludes amounts attributable to the provincial 
treasuries. refer to note 28.2.2 for movements on the ecl allowance. the legal agreements relating to state-owned entities are in the 
process of being updated and were not finalised by 31 march 2024.

exceed its liabilities. when recalled, the subsidiary has the option to convert the loan to share capital. the loan is included in the 
books of the subsidiary as a separate category of equity and is thus treated as an addition to the sarb’s investment in subsidiary.

33.3.1 impairment on investment in associate
an impairment test for the investment in associate is only required when there is an indicator of impairment. however, due to the purpose 
of this investment being linked to the mandate of the sarb, an annual impairment test is performed periodically to closely monitor the 
investment.
the performance of abhl declined in the current financial year and resulted in a more conservative outlook on estimated future cash 
flows. as a result, the estimated recoverable amount of the investment decreased in the current year and an impairment loss of 
r982 million (2023: r621 million reversal) was recognised in profit or loss.
the recoverable amount of r3.1 billion (2023: r4.1 billion) was calculated by means of the ‘fair value less costs to sell’ method, using the 
discounted cash flow technique.
management made the following key assumptions in its determination of fair value less costs to sell:
• abhl is a going concern and would be able to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
• future cash flows were based on financial budgets approved by abhl management covering a four-year period.
• the growth rate for cash flows into perpetuity was calculated with reference to the sarb published inflation target range of 
3% – 6%.
• a discount rate of 18.62% (2023: 18.34%) was used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. the discount rate was 
determined using the capital asset pricing model, based on the below key inputs in various scenarios at the time of the valuation:
– south african risk free rate of 12.27% based on the daily average yield on government bonds with an outstanding maturity of 
10 years and longer.
– beta of 0.78 and equity market risk premium of 5.56% based on quoted indicators of similar listed entities.
– alpha risk adjustment of 2% to adjust for the inherent uncertainty in long-term cash flow forecasts.

independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of the south african reserve 
bank 
our opinion 
in our opinion, the financial accounts of the prudential authority (the pa) are prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the basis of accounting described in note 1 to the financial accounts and the requirements 
of section 55 of the financial sector regulation act 9 of 2017. 
what we have audited 
the pa’s financial accounts are set out on pages 133 to 135. the pa’s financial accounts comprise the 
statement of financial position at 31 march 2024, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income for the year then ended and the notes to the financial accounts, which include significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information. 
basis for opinion 
we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing (isas). our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
accounts section of our report. 
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. 
independence 
we are independent of the pa in accordance with the independent regulatory board for auditors’ code of 
professional conduct for registered auditors (irba code) and other independence requirements applicable to 
performing audits of financial statements in south africa. we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with the irba code and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing 
audits in south africa. the irba code is consistent with the corresponding sections of the international ethics 
standards board for accountants’ international code of ethics for professional accountants (including 
international independence standards). 
emphasis of matter - basis of accounting 
we draw attention to note 1 to the financial accounts, which describes the basis of accounting. the financial 
accounts are prepared for the purpose described therein. as a result, the financial accounts may not be suitable 
for another purpose. 
the financial accounts do not comprise a full set of financial statements and are prepared in accordance with 
the basis of accounting described in note 1 to the financial accounts and the requirements of section 55 of 
the financial sector regulation act 9 of 2017. our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

responsibilities of the directors for the financial accounts 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of these financial accounts in accordance with note 1 to the 
financial accounts and the requirements of section 55 of the financial sector regulation act 9 of 2017, for 
determining that the basis of preparation is acceptable in the circumstances and for such internal control as the 
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial accounts that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
in preparing the financial accounts, the directors are responsible for assessing the pa’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the sarb or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so. 
auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial accounts 
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial accounts as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial accounts. 
as part of an audit in accordance with isas, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. we also: 
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial accounts, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the pa’s internal control.
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates,
if any, and related disclosures made by directors.
• conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the pa’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the
financial accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. however, future events or conditions
may cause the pa to cease to continue as a going concern.
we communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.

1. accounting policies
1.1. other assets
other assets relate to the notional balance at the end of the reporting period, which represents the difference between cash inflows 
and outflows during the year in respect of prudential regulatory activity, as well as prepaid expenses. prepaid expenses relate to 
operating costs paid before they are due. the prepaid expenses are measured at cost and are recognised when the amount is paid. 
the prepaid expense balances are subsequently measured at cost and are derecognised in the period in which the related expense 
is recognised.
1.2. other liabilities
other liabilities relate to operating income received in advance. the liabilities are measured at the amount actually received and 
recognised when the amount is received. the balance is subsequently measured at cost and is derecognised in the period in which 
the related income is recognised.
1.3. unclaimed balances
unclaimed balances relate to amounts recovered from an illegal deposit-taking scheme. the amounts recognised are owed to 
unidentified investors of the scheme who are yet to claim the amounts due to them. the unclaimed balances are recognised when 
the amounts are recovered from the scheme and are measured at the amount payable to the investors, being the amount actually 
recovered. the unclaimed balances are subsequently measured at cost and are derecognised when the amounts are paid to the 
relevant investors or upon expiry of the right to claim.
1.4. operating income
operating income consists of levies, fees and penalties charged to financial institutions. the levies, fees and income are charged 
and measured in accordance with the relevant legislation. operating income is recognised per the amount invoiced to the financial 
institution, in the period in which the amount relates.
1.5. personnel and operating costs
personnel and operating costs relate to direct costs incurred for the administration of the pa. these costs are measured at the 
transaction amount and are recognised as expenses in the period incurred.
1.6. amounts borne by the sarb
net costs incurred for the administration of the pa, borne by the sarb. these costs are measured at the transaction amount and 
are recognised as expenses in the period incurred, net of recoveries.
2. explanatory notes
2.1. levies are applicable for the current financial year since the financial sector and deposit insurance levies (administration) and 
deposit insurance premiums act 12 of 2022, as well as certain provisions of the fsr act became effective from 1 april 2023. this 
legislation permits the pa to charge levies to regulated financial institutions, in order to cover the direct operating costs of the pa and 
not in return for any direct service or goods that will be supplied.
2.2. fees are “transaction-based” and are charged to fund the pa’s performance of specific functions under the fsr act and the 
relevant sector laws it regulates.
2.3. penalties are raised for non-compliance by persons within the regulated sector should they be found guilty of contravening a 
financial sector law or an enforceable undertaking accepted by the pa. the pa deducts from this total all costs incurred in making and 
enforcing the administrative penalty order. the remaining balance after applying this deduction is paid into the national revenue fund 
(if any). the sarb also has a responsibility in terms of the financial intelligence centre act 38 of 2001 act (fica) to ensure that 
banks and life insurance companies comply with (fica). the sarb has authority in terms of the section 45c of (fica) to impose 
administrative sanctions on these entities if and when they fail to comply with a provision, order, determination or directive made in 
terms of this act. the sarb issues notices with the said penalties to the relevant entities but does not account for the penalties in its 
financial statements as the penalties imposed are paid directly to the nrf. total penalties issued on behalf of the sa government in 
this regard amounted to r1.0 million (2023: r4.1 million).

2.4. personnel and operating costs consist of only the direct costs related to the administration of the pa. although the pa uses 
the various support departments of the sarb and incurs costs from these services (such as legal services, it, risk management, 
compliance, internal audit, hr, international economic relations and policy, security and facilities), these costs are borne by the sarb.
