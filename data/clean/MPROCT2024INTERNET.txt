preface
the primary mandate of the (sarb) is to achieve and maintain price stability in the interest of 
balanced and sustainable economic growth. in addition, the sarb has a complementary mandate to oversee and maintain 
financial stability.
price stability helps to protect the purchasing power and living standards of all south africans. it provides a favourable 
environment for investment and job creation and supports international competitiveness. the goal of price stability is quantified 
through an inflation target, which is set in consultation with government. the target is a range of 3–6%, which has been in 
place since 2000. 
the sarb has full operational independence. monetary policy decisions are made by the sarb’s monetary policy committee 
(mpc), which is chaired by the governor and includes the deputy governors and other senior officials of the sarb.
the inflation-targeting framework is flexible, meaning that policymakers will seek to look through temporary shocks, thereby 
avoiding excessive volatility in interest rates and economic output. the mpc takes a forward-looking approach to account for 
the time lags between policy adjustments and economic effects. mpc decisions are communicated at a press conference at 
the end of each meeting, accompanied by a comprehensive statement.
the monetary policy review (mpr) is published twice a year and is aimed at broadening the public’s understanding of 
the objectives and conduct of monetary policy. the mpr covers domestic and international developments that affect the 
monetary policy stance. 
the mpr is presented by senior officials of the sarb at monetary policy forum meetings held at major centres across south 
africa in an effort to develop a better understanding of monetary policy through direct interactions with stakeholders.

executive summary and 
overview of the policy stance
with the pandemic surge receding, inflation is slowly returning 
to targets and central banks have begun normalising policy 
with gradual cuts in interest rates. central banks are likely to 
move cautiously, however, with still sticky services and wage 
inflation, ongoing uncertainty about the available policy space 
and with an eye on possible price shocks on the horizon. south 
africa’s inflation has also softened, with the august print falling 
just below the target midpoint, while risks to the forecast have 
become more balanced. while headline inflation in the near 
term will benefit from lower fuel prices, it is expected to remain 
around 4.5% over the forecast period. with this backdrop, the 
monetary policy committee (mpc) lowered the repurchase 
(repo) rate by 25 basis points in september 2024 to 8.0%. the 
economy is projected to expand by 1.1% this year, rising to 
1.8% in 2026. the upgraded forecast is premised on the much-
improved electricity supply, alongside a better-functioning 
logistics sector and lower inflation and interest rates.
still riding the swells
from the peak rate of 8.7% reached in 2022, global inflation 
continues to moderate and should get to about 5.4% this year.1 
in some countries, inflation has closed in on policy targets, 
allowing central banks to start easing interest rates. in others, 
inflation remains high. services price inflation has remained 
sticky in many economies and wages elevated in some, keeping 
core inflation higher than is consistent with central banks’ 
targets. a range of prices, from fuel to food, remain unstable, 
contributing to significant volatility in monthly inflation outcomes 
that has tended to increase forecast uncertainties and add 
inertia to disinflation. geopolitical threats to supply chains and 
trade remain an ongoing concern, while high debt levels and 
climate change further cloud the medium-term horizon. 
over much of the past year, the path for global inflation remained 
unclear. food and fuel inflation eventually decelerated and 
pulled headline lower. services price increases and other parts 
of core inflation, however, proved resistant to slowing for much 
of the period, putting into question central bank policy settings. 
even though policy settings were restrictive when viewed in the 
context of recent history, and recessions were feared, inflation 
outcomes suggested different interpretations. for much of the 
past year, uncertainty prevailed about whether policy settings 
were sufficient to return inflation back to target on credible 
time frames.

part of the challenge in understanding the mixed inflation 
trajectory lies in the surprising resilience of the global economy. 
high savings by households and firms during the pandemic 
and aggressive fiscal expansions supported a sustained 
consumption of goods and then services, which drove up 
prices sequentially. while central banks responded to the 
higher inflation with restrictive policy, some prices, such as 
for food, fuel and commodities, were already easing. china’s 
weaker growth helped to dampen commodity prices and 
reduced imported goods inflation, providing further support to 
economic activity in much of the world. in many places, fiscal 
policy remained highly expansionary. 
structural factors also played a role in keeping core inflation 
elevated, and some may continue to do so. services 
consumption has stayed surprisingly strong even as the 
pandemic faded further into the background, as labour 
markets have remained tight. an important measure of 
growth and labour demand in advanced economies – the 
number of job vacancies per unemployed person – stayed high 
for much of the year in most major economies but has recently 
fallen towards pre-pandemic levels. 
nonetheless, the longer-term outlook remains unclear. despite 
robust levels of migration working to loosen labour markets 
in advanced economies, ageing populations and lower 
participation rates suggest the opposite. the large fiscal 
deficits and public borrowing of the pandemic have also been 
prolonged, in part due to new demands for investment in 
energy infrastructure but also other demands for support to 
households. much of this fiscal stimulus has worked against 
monetary policy efforts to lower inflation faster and may 
continue to provide support for it. more broadly, escalating 
demand for capital is likely to keep neutral interest rate levels 
well above those prevailing in the pre-pandemic era. 
such countervailing pressures and ensuing uncertainties instil 
caution in policymaking, a feature of central banking that is 
likely to remain even as disinflation continues. 
the greater part of the global disinflation we have seen over the 
past year has occurred in advanced economies and central 
banks have become more confident about its trajectory. 
accordingly, except for japan, major global central banks 
have begun normalising policy. to date, the european central 
bank (ecb) and bank of england (boe) have lowered rates by 
a cumulative 50 basis points and 25 basis points respectively. 
the ecb was the first to cut in june this year, followed by the 
boe in august. the united states (us) federal reserve (fed) 
conducted its first rate cut of 50 basis points in september.

emerging markets have experienced similar challenges of 
stubborn (core) inflation and volatile monthly inflation data. 
where easing in policy rates has been possible, as in some 
latin american economies, adverse inflation outcomes along 
with fiscal and political challenges have forced some of them to 
pause and, in the case of brazil, to hike again, despite still high 
real policy rates. emerging markets, however, should benefit 
from the shift in advanced economies towards greater easing. 
south africa, for instance, which we discuss in greater depth 
in the next section, has seen a strengthening of the rand which 
has put significant downward pressure on inflation. 
from a global perspective, monetary policy has been restrictive 
enough to get inflation sustainably lower, but the policy space 
available may be unusually limited. estimates of neutral 
rates may adjust higher (box 3), while policy missteps risk 
putting disinflation in doubt or even cause inflation reversals. 
in summary, global inflation should continue to ease, but 
uncertainties about its trajectory as well as the effectiveness of 
policy will remain high in an era of significant change.
last year, the world economy grew by 3.3%, aided by relatively 
strong demand and expansionary fiscal policies in advanced 
economies. however, activity levels varied across countries, 
with the us strongly outperforming its advanced economy 
peers, a pattern that continued into 2024. nonetheless, that 
diverging growth trend has narrowed this year as activity 
improves in some of the laggards. large emerging economies 
also exhibited diverse growth rates, with india growing robustly 
and china’s output moderating. because china’s economic 
output is more commodity-intensive than any other economy, 
its activity slowdown has depressed commodity prices, 
impacting growth in commodity-exporting emerging markets 
such as south africa.2
risks to global growth appear balanced. while interest rate 
cuts should provide a boost to consumption and investment, 
protectionist measures and geopolitical fragmentation 
will likely continue to weigh on global trade. 3 the policy 
uncertainty associated with political developments in various 
regions of the world also present risks to global growth and 
inflation. china’s recent efforts to support growth may carry 
upside surprises to global growth, in part through stronger 
commodity prices. 
equally, while the expected fiscal consolidations that are 
required to lower debt levels may reduce growth (and 
inflation) in the near term, lower inflation supports easier credit 
conditions, providing impetus to growth over the medium 
term. over the longer term, sustainable growth will need to 
be achieved with a better balance between public and private 
demand for scarce savings.

taking these and other considerations into account, the south 
african reserve bank (sarb) projects moderate trading-
partner growth of 2.7% this year (from 3.0% the year before), 
rising to 3.1% in 2026. the somewhat muted global growth 
should help keep demand pressures contained, supporting 
the ongoing disinflation.
domestic economic developments
in contrast to global inflation, the domestic inflation narrative has 
shifted markedly in recent months. after rising and remaining 
sticky in the upper half of the target band for much of the review 
period, headline inflation dropped in july and august 2024, 
printing slightly below the midpoint of the 3–6% target band 
in august. while the turn in headline inflation reflects a range 
of factors including the moderation in brent crude oil prices, 
the recent marked strengthening of the rand has underpinned 
the broad-based disinflation in fuel and goods prices. 
underlying inflation pressures, which remained elevated 
above the midpoint over the past year, have also eased. core 
inflation, the sarb’s primary indicator of underlying inflation, 
has since april 2024 moved closer to the midpoint, and dipped 
below it in july (4.3%) and further to 4.1% in august. softer 
core inflation reflects the marked moderation in core goods 
inflation on the back of a strong rand benefitting from, among 
other factors, the rise in the real policy rate. services inflation 
remained closer to the target midpoint over the review period, 
moving within a narrow range. although components such as 
miscellaneous services have tended to pull services inflation 
higher, this was more than offset by the subdued housing and 
utilities component. 
meanwhile, inflation expectations held by firms, unions and 
financial analysts have eased appreciably this year, with 
two-years-ahead expectations at 4.8% in the third quarter. 
the recent subdued headline inflation outcomes, if sustained, 
should induce further declines in inflation expectations. in 
turn, lower inflation expectations should help to mute nominal 
wage growth and ultimately services inflation, although the 
risk of higher-than-projected wage increases due to backward 
indexation remains. 
with both core goods and services inflation expected to 
ease further, core inflation is forecast to undershoot the 
target midpoint this year, averaging 4.4% (4.8% in 2023) and 
to remain below it for the remainder of the forecast horizon. 
headline inflation is expected to average 4.6% (5.1% in the 
march forecast) in 2024 and to undershoot the target midpoint 
from the third quarter of this year through to the end of the 
forecast period. 
over the next three quarters headline inflation is expected to 
print in the bottom half of the 3–6% target band, averaging 
3.7%. these mainly reflect strong fuel deflation and markedly 
lower food inflation. as these outcomes are driven mainly by

supply side factors, including exchange rate strength, policy 
focus will be on second-round effects – an approach taken 
symmetrically – for upside or downside shocks.
the apparent progress on the inflation front has not been 
mirrored on the output dimension, yet. growth weakened 
sharply over the past year, largely due to supply constraints. 
load-shedding and logistical challenges, along with policy 
uncertainty, weighed heavily on economic activity and 
sentiment, depressing business credit appetite and household 
spending. gross domestic product (gdp) expanded at 
a modest rate of 0.7% in 2023, down from 1.9% in 2022, 
worsening south africa’s growth gap vis-à-vis peer emerging 
markets for whom growth averaged 4.4% in the past year.4
on a quarterly basis, the domestic economy recorded no 
growth in the first quarter of this year, followed by a modest 
rebound of 0.4% in the second quarter. the sarb projects 
near-term growth of 0.6% in the third and fourth quarters as 
household spending gets a boost from declining inflation and 
the two-pot retirement reform (box 5) respectively.
looking forward, south africa’s growth performance is 
forecast to improve. private investment in renewable energy, 
increased maintenance by eskom and transmission system 
development, along with reforms in ports and rail, should 
further reduce energy and logistical constraints. as the 
economy’s productive potential improves and inflation eases, 
so too will corporate and household balance sheets, further 
improving sentiment and investment beyond the network 
sectors. the economy is expected to grow by 1.1% this year, 
rising to 1.8% by 2026. that growth remains well below the 
estimated long-run, steady-state level of 2.5%, however, is in 
large part because the prolonged supply-side constraints have 
eroded the economy’s productive capacity (box 4). strong 
growth in investment will be needed to make up for that loss of 
capacity and jobs.
despite the fading commodity revenue windfall and muted 
growth, fiscal consolidation is progressing. considerable 
success was achieved in the 2023/24 fiscal year as national 
treasury delivered the first primary surplus in 15 years. 
meanwhile, year-to-date revenue and expenditure trends, 
where the main budget revenue and expenditure are up by 
19.1% and 4.3% respectively, raise the prospect of another 
primary surplus this financial year. the boost in revenue, 
however, came mostly from the drawdown of the gold and 
foreign exchange contingency reserve account (gfecra). 
this, along with improved sentiment following the formation of 
a government of national unity (gnu) after the may elections, 
has helped compress the risk premium and the yield curve. 
the long end of the curve has shifted lower by about 200 basis 
points since april 2024.

overview of the policy stance
south africa’s inflation experience has been more muted 
than in much of the rest of the world, with monetary policy 
helping to shape those better outcomes. the start to policy 
normalisation in late november 2021 and the gradual move to 
reduce monetary accommodation helped to slow the rise in 
inflation at a time when pent-up demand was high and supply 
was severely constrained. policy, however, remained broadly 
accommodative until the 50 basis point hike in may 2023. 
since then, monetary policy has been moderately restrictive, 
dampening growth in aggregate demand and helping to 
keep it in balance with constrained supply. this, along 
with the favourable unwinding of food and fuel prices, saw 
inflation soften and the inflation forecast improve significantly, 
especially compared to earlier in the year. for two of the three 
mpc meetings covered in this monetary policy review (mpr) 
(may and july 2024), the policy rate was unchanged.
risk assessments by the mpc shifted across meetings, 
from being balanced in the may meeting (but with a higher 
inflation forecast trajectory) to being tilted to the upside in the 
july meeting, given a downwardly revised baseline quarterly 
projection model (qpm) inflation forecast profile. common 
global risks included slower-than-expected global disinflation 
and geopolitical tensions. domestic risks included elevated 
inflation expectations and lingering concerns about food and 
administered prices, particularly the price of electricity. 5
nonetheless, the inflation forecast improved significantly 
over this period and inflation expectations continued to ease 
(box 1). in the march 2024 forecast headline inflation was seen 
averaging 5.1% this year and declining to 4.6% in 2025 and 
4.5% in 2026. the may meeting projected headline inflation 
of 5.1% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. the july meeting forecast 
headline inflation of 4.9% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. with the 
baseline inflation projection easing, the qpm signaled rate 
cuts at each of the three meetings covered in this review. after 
weighing the risks to the inflation outlook, however, the mpc 
kept rates unchanged in the may and july mpc meetings.
the general improvement in the forecasts over the review 
period brought forward the point at which headline inflation was 
expected to reach the target midpoint and, assuming no new 
shocks, remain around that level. the qpm baseline forecast 
in the may mpc meeting had headline inflation converging to 
the target midpoint from 2025, but this was revised forward 
in the july mpc meeting to the fourth quarter of this year. 
5 the quarterly projection model (qpm) baseline projection is risk-neutral, 
while scenarios are provided that may generate additional implications 
for inflation and interest rates. the monetary policy committee (mpc) 
considers the scenarios and other factors, global and domestic, 
that exhibit upside or downside risks and that are then set out in the 
statement relative to the baseline (box 2). often risks that feature in 
scenarios end up as part of the baseline in subsequent forecasts.

the september forecast brought the convergence date 
further forward, to the third quarter of this year, and provided 
greater confidence about the near-term inflation trajectory. 
these revisions reflected progressively better outcomes (and 
projections) for all the components of headline inflation, except 
for electricity.
the september forecast showed headline inflation averaging 
4.6% this year and undershooting the target over the medium 
term, while the mpc assessed inflation risks to be broadly 
balanced. this, along with the more muted baseline profile 
for inflation, prompted the mpc to lower the repo rate at the 
september meeting by 25 basis points, bringing the policy rate 
down to 8.0%. the decision moved the policy rate closer to the 
path projected by the qpm.6
despite the lowering of the repo rate by 25 basis points, policy 
is still moderately restrictive, with the real repo rate gap – a 
measure of the policy stance – averaging 1.6% this year. this 
measure of the policy stance then declines sharply to 0.3% 
next year and -0.1% in 2026.
conclusion
the continued moderation in global headline inflation over the 
past six months, along with signs of cooling labour markets, 
suggests that tight monetary policy is helping to soften demand, 
despite stickiness in some services inflation components. this 
has given central banks greater confidence that disinflation will 
continue, assuming no new major shocks. accordingly, global 
central banks have entered an easing cycle, with the fed joining 
the other major central banks this past september. central 
banks, however, are taking a cautious, data-dependent, risk 
management approach, with modest cuts followed by pauses 
to assess the appropriateness of the policy stance.
the sarb’s mpc lowered the repo rate by 25 basis points at 
the september 2024 meeting. policy decisions will continue to 
be guided by incoming data as the mpc seeks to protect the 
purchasing power of the rand in the interest of balanced and 
sustainable economic growth. other actions that can support 
stronger output growth include achieving a prudent public 
debt level, further progress in the implementation of structural 
reforms and the better alignment of administered prices growth 
with the expected low-inflation environment.
6 the qpm suggested a rate cut of 50 basis points in the may mpc 
forecast. with the mpc keeping the repo rate on hold, the qpm 
again suggested a cut of 50 basis points in the july mpc forecast 
and, for similar reasons, a cut of similar magnitude for the fourth 
quarter of this year (september and november meetings together).

3 ten-year rolling regressions of two-years-ahead inflation expectations on 
contemporaneous inflation outcomes are run. the sensitivity measure is

from said regression. see k lansing and f nucera, ‘inflation expectations, 
the phillips curve, and stock prices’, federal reserve bank of san 
francisco economic letters, 2023–24, san francisco: federal reserve 
bank of san francisco, december 2023.
inflation-targeting central banks set monetary policy to ensure that, 
in the absence of permanent shocks, inflation stabilises around the 
target over the medium term. a key variable in policy setting is the 
way in which economic agents (firms, households and the government) 
react to temporary and permanent shocks to inflation and output. if 
these agents believe the long-run forecast of the central bank (i.e. 
the announced inflation target), then their expectations are said to 
be ‘anchored’ and their behaviour (output and pricing decisions) will 
be consistent with the inflation target. this, in turn, implies that the 
central bank can look past temporary supply shocks, keeping interest 
rates more stable and reducing the short-term cost of achieving lower 
inflation.1 when inflation expectations are not at the central bank’s 
announced target, higher policy credibility is associated with their faster 
and less costly convergence to target.2
very large and persistent shocks such as the pandemic and its 
aftermath, however, can unmoor expectations. as inflation surged in 
2022–23, south africa’s two-years-ahead inflation expectations rose 
markedly and drifted away from the preferred 4.5% midpoint of the 
sarb’s inflation target band (box 8, april 2023 mpr). a key policy 
question is whether inflation expectations have re-anchored.
inflation expectations are considered better anchored if they cluster 
around the central bank’s announced target and are relatively insensitive 
to recent and current inflation outcomes.
data show that the degree of anchoring improved between 2017 and 
2019. this followed the ’s (sarb) express 
communication about its preference for inflation to settle closer to the 
midpoint of the 3–6% target band. however, the complex nature of the 
pandemic, the policy responses to it, the unfolding developments in 
supply chains and commodities prices and how economies responded 
to the end of the pandemic made inflation expectations much more 
sensitive to current developments.3 
more recently, with inflation falling from the highs reached in 2022, 
inflation expectations have also eased but remain above the target 
midpoint. nonetheless, underlying analytics give reason for optimism. 
in particular, improved anchoring is suggested by the clustering of 
two-years-ahead expectations of business survey respondents. the 
distribution has shifted leftwards and compressed with its centre closer 
to the 4.5% midpoint, indicating more agreement among respondents.
the sarb policy actions, consistency in communications and 
credibility may have helped to reverse the de-anchoring of inflation 
expectations, minimising any costs of sustainably achieving the inflation 
target over the medium term. nevertheless, the task of firmly anchoring 
expectations is not yet complete.

box 2 inflation risk: listing or more balanced? 
1 other risks considered by the monetary policy committee (mpc) in recent 
meetings include sharply higher oil prices, rand depreciation, escalation 
in geopolitical tensions in the middle east and upside/downside budget 
scenarios.
monetary policy requires the forecasting of inflation and assessing 
the risk that it surprises higher or lower over the short, medium and 
longer run. these assessments are often aided by forecast scenarios, 
alternatives to the baseline that reflect what happens when specified 
risks materialise. at the september monetary policy committee (mpc) 
meeting, the mpc assessed risks to the baseline inflation forecast to 
be balanced – equal probabilities that inflation would turn out higher or 
lower than in the baseline. this box presents the scenarios considered 
by the mpc at the september 2024 meeting.1 
one scenario featured the risk of higher inflation, represented by faster 
electricity price inflation, stronger wage growth and rising rental inflation. 
the downside risk scenario considered a marked strengthening of 
the rand.

global economy: 
steady as she goes
the world economy is projected to expand by 3.2% this year 
and by 3.3% in 2025, broadly unchanged from the pace set in 
2023. across the world’s major economies, the us appears 
to be headed for a soft landing, underpinned by still solid 
household spending and labour market, while economic 
performance in the eurozone and china has generally 
disappointed. services sectors continue to drive much of the 
growth in global economic activity, but this has come at a cost 
of stickier services inflation. despite this stickiness, headline 
inflation has continued to recede on the back of much softer 
goods price inflation – providing room for central banks to 
initiate easing cycles. at this time, the future pace and depth of 
rate cuts remain uncertain.
steady, modest growth 
the global economy continues to expand at a steady yet 
modest pace. manufacturing output has been broadly stable, 
while services sectors continue to grow. while this pattern 
of economic activity primarily reflects global consumption 
still shifting away from manufactured goods, the loss of 
momentum in private fixed investment, particularly in advanced 
economies, has also played a role. an expected turnaround 
in the manufacturing sector has yet to materialise. the global 
purchasing managers’ index (pmi) for manufacturing has been 
stuck around the neutral 50 index point level for most of this 
year, while new orders received by global manufacturers have 
remained in contractionary territory. major manufacturers, such 
as germany and china, have been especially hard hit by this 
stagnation. tight lending standards of most loan categories 
across major advanced economies, alongside high interest 
rates, have additionally contributed to lower credit demand, 
further denting consumption of durable goods. 
more service-oriented economies alternately, continue to do 
well. the us economy has remained resilient and continues 
to outperform its advanced economy peers. spending by us 
households remains strong, underpinned by growth in real 
personal income and a still firm labour market. the recent 
50  basis point reduction in the federal funds rate should provide 
additional impetus to economic activity. the us economy is 
forecast to expand by 2.6% this year before slowing to 1.9% in 
2025.7 these projected growth rates contrast sharply with the 
narrative that the us economy will see a hard landing next year. 
instead, a soft landing appears more likely. 
outside of the us, the growth performance among advanced 
economies is mixed. activity in the eurozone remains subdued 
due to weak domestic demand and muted manufacturing 
activity. however, recent rate cuts should support household

indicated otherwise, from the imf’s weo update of july 2024.

consumption, prompting expectations of a mild expansion 
of 0.9% for the eurozone this year. following sharply weaker 
activity levels at the start of this year, momentum in the 
japanese economy remains low. the economy is projected to 
grow by 0.7% in 2024, down from a robust growth rate of 1.9% 
in the previous year. on the other hand, real gdp in the united 
kingdom (uk) has been recovering steadily amid firm activity in 
the services sector. falling inflation and slightly lower borrowing 
costs should support economic activity, boosting growth to 
0.7% this year, up from 0.1% in the previous year and rising to 
1.5% in 2025.
across emerging and developing markets, asia’s economies 
have been an important source of growth for the world 
economy. the indian economy has shown significant 
resilience and is expected to expand by 7.0% this year and by 
6.5% in 2025, underpinned by strong household consumption 
spending. economic growth in china, however, has weakened 
in recent quarters despite a firm start to the year. growth in 
the chinese economy is expected to slow to 5.0% this year 
from 5.2% in 2023, as the weakness in the property sector 
persists and credit demand remains muted. however, the 
recent stimuli by the people’s bank of china (pboc) as well 
as expectations of additional fiscal measures should support 
output expansion. in latin american countries, economic 
activity remains robust, with output largely at potential. this is 
despite restrictive monetary policy stances where real policy 
rates are well above long-term averages. across sub-saharan 
africa, economic activity is expected to expand by 3.7% this 
year, largely on account of stronger growth in nigeria (3.1%), 
while south africa, at 1.1% growth this year, continues to drag 
the region’s average lower.
disinflation on track but 
uncertainty remains 
global disinflation has progressed over the past two years 
despite occasional setbacks. after averaging 6.8% in 2023, 
global inflation is projected to soften to 5.4% this year and 
further to 4.4% in 2025, still well above the 2.5% average of 
the 2010–19 period. disinflation has been driven primarily 
by goods, with prices of food, energy and some imported 
goods falling in most advanced economies. meanwhile, global 
services inflation has remained relatively sticky, in part due 
to tight labour markets and reflecting an important feedback 
loop from wages to prices. since services price disinflation is 
slow, uncertainty about the return of inflation back to target 
remains elevated.8 for instance, in the us and eurozone, some 
components of services inflation, including rents, health and 
recreational services, remain well above the 2.0% inflation 
target and in some cases are even accelerating. 9

the last mile of post-covid-19 disinflation’, bis quarterly review , basel: 
bank for international settlements, march 2024.

inflation was 9.0% in the eurozone.

while the global trend has been towards disinflation, there are 
some exceptions. deflationary risks have persisted in china 
where inflation has remained close to 0% over the past two 
years as the prolonged slump in the housing market and 
job uncertainty continue to weigh on consumer spending. 
meanwhile, a tight labour market and supply shortages due to 
the ongoing sanctions have reignited inflation in russia, while 
strong economic activity and a depreciated currency have 
contributed to the recent upside surprise in brazil’s inflation. 
across the world’s major advanced economies, however, labour 
market conditions have so far been mixed – cooling somewhat 
in the us but remaining relatively tight in the eurozone and uk. in 
the us, where quit rates soared early in the pandemic recovery 
as demand for labour outpaced its supply, the beveridge curve 
(that links vacancies to unemployment) shifted to the right and 
steepened, implying a stronger bargaining power for workers. 
however, the us beveridge curve has now returned closer to 
the levels it was before the pandemic while unit labour costs 
(ulcs) were only up by 0.5% year on year in the second 
quarter of this year. meanwhile, high vacancy rates and lower 
unemployment in the eurozone have fanned labour shortages, 
inducing firms to hoard labour. this pattern of high vacancy 
rates and low unemployment is also observed in the uk. tight 
labour markets, together with labour hoarding practices, could 
add to wage pressures while reducing productivity, raising 
firms’ ulcs. nevertheless, growth in negotiated wages in the 
eurozone slowed to 3.5% year on year in the second quarter, 
down from 4.7% in the previous quarter.
labour markets also remain relatively tight in many emerging 
markets, with markedly low unemployment rates compared 
with the pre-pandemic period, especially in mexico, the 
philippines and czech republic. encouragingly, evidence is 
building that labour markets have started to cool across major 
economies, but this could be a slow grind amid still strong 
services sector activity.
while expectations are for inflation to return to the 2.0% 
target in major advanced economies by the end of 2025, 
risks remain. elevated services inflation amid tight labour 
markets and relatively high wage inflation could upend the 
disinflationary process. equally, global shipping rates have 
risen since the start of the year, which could potentially feed 
into renewed supply pressures and thus goods inflation. the 
good news for major central banks, however, is that longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained generally well anchored, 
suggesting that monetary policy credibility remains intact.
global easing cycle broadens
global monetary policy is in an easing cycle even if it is not 
synchronised across countries and regions. the us fed 
joined the cycle in september, following rate cuts in several 
advanced economies, including canada, the eurozone, uk 
and switzerland. japan, however, has been a key exception 
as it continues to raise rates moderately from its previously 
accommodative setting. some latin american countries have

been easing interest rates since the second quarter of 2023, 
while a few central banks in emerging asia have started cutting 
interest rates. 
however, central banks have exhibited caution in adjusting rates 
due to idiosyncratic inflation dynamics, with cuts often followed 
by pauses. some early interest rate cutters such as brazil had 
to reverse course, raising rates again in september as inflation 
expectations jumped higher. rising inflation expectations 
reflect concerns that despite relatively high interest rates, loose 
fiscal policy is inconsistent with more resilient growth and tight 
labour markets. 
the outlook for interest rates is for a gradual easing in policy 
rates, with data dependency a central theme. the extent of 
policy easing, however, is complicated by the uncertainty 
surrounding estimates of the neutral rate. across most 
advanced economies, current real rates are above long-run 
real rate averages. compared with the neutral rates estimated 
during the pandemic, real rate levels suggest restrictive 
monetary policy conditions. sticky inflation, however, has 
prompted new estimates that suggest that neutral rates have 
risen since the covid-19 pandemic and are unlikely to return 
to the levels seen prior to the pandemic (box 3).
not without risks
overall, risks to the global growth and inflation outlook 
appear balanced. downside risks to growth stem from a 
sharp slowdown or recession in the us, along with possible 
debt defaults given the elevated global debt level. upside 
risks to inflation emanate from a lack of progress on services 
disinflation as well as an escalation of geopolitical tensions that 
could sharply increase the cost of imported goods along the 
supply chain. these considerations, along with the prospect of 
a higher r-star, raise the likelihood that interest rates will remain 
higher than they were before the pandemic.

october 2024
box 3 what is the speed limit?
as the post-pandemic inflation surge moderates, policy space opens 
for central banks to ease interest rates. much like a speed limit that 
is dependent on road conditions, the r-star, or neutral real interest 
rate, provides guidance on the pace of tightening or easing.1 given an 
expected inflation rate, is the policy rate adding to or taking away from 
future inflation? r-star also serves as the point at which, in steady 
state, any policy normalisation should end.
a challenge lies in estimating the neutral rate with precision, especially 
when major shocks and structural forces, as experienced in recent 
years, cause large changes in economic relationships, patterns of 
activity and/or prompt major policy shifts. in the decade after the 
global financial crisis, global neutral real rates were estimated to have 
declined to around 0% from around 4% in the 1990s (see box 2 in 
the april 2022 mpr). 
in the wake of the pandemic, however, the massive increase in 
demand on global saving and sharply higher inflation have generated 
new estimates that show that r-star has risen.2 a higher r-star suggests 
the need for higher policy rates to re-anchor inflation in the wake of the 
kinds of shocks that drove it up. 
an additional complication with r-star presents itself to small, more 
open economies such as south africa, as these are, by definition, 
more affected by external economic shocks, especially those 
emanating from large global economies and key trading partners. 
relative interest rates and growth rates influence flows of capital, 
while relative price and income shocks impact on trade in goods and 
services. when small, open economies run financial deficits and need 
to draw on foreign savings, these interdependencies become even 
more important.3 
the ’s (sarb) running estimate of the 
neutral rate for south africa reflects a mix of global neutral rates 
alongside a premium to compensate for country risk. 4 south africa’s 
neutral real rate declined between 2000 and 2010, reflecting a 
moderating global r-star and a declining risk premium on the back 
of the marked improvement in the country’s fiscal position (fiscal 
surpluses in 2005/06 and a debt-to-gdp ratio falling to below 30% 
by 2010). however, this decline was reversed in the aftermath of

1 r-star is the real interest rate that is consistent with the economy 
being at full employment and inflation being stable around the target. 
the rise in short-term r-star is influenced by supply shocks as well

the global financial crisis as the global neutral rate started to rise and 
south africa’s debt position deteriorated. for over a decade, global 
r-star had a moderating influence on the domestic r-star, before 
reversing course. 
how much room to ease?
despite the challenges of estimating neutral rates, central banks look 
to benchmark a ‘real interest rate gap’ by taking their estimates and 
comparing them to an ex-ante real policy rate. 5 comparative real 
rate gaps are shown in the adjacent chart, helping to illustrate how 
domestic factors shape rates expected by the markets. the rates 
gap is larger in countries that are subject to idiosyncratic shocks or 
constraints. russia, for instance, is exposed to price pressures linked 
to sanctions, while mexico’s inflation is, alongside a large fiscal deficit, 
highly sensitive to rates differentials with the united states (us). in 
south africa and india, by contrast, smaller gaps reflect less sensitivity 
to global factors and better fundamentals.6
overall, easing cycles are expected to vary across countries and, 
given data-dependency, rate paths remain uncertain, presenting 
risks of heightened volatility in financial markets. what seems likely, 
however, is that easing cycles this time will be shorter and shallower 
than in previous episodes, leaving rates higher than they were before 
the pandemic.
5 the ex-ante policy rate is the current policy rate less the three-quarters-
ahead (end-2025) expected consumer price inflation, as per the 
bloomberg median forecast.
6 for instance, the small real interest rate gap in south africa and india 
reflects that interest rates were hiked by relatively less compared with 
peers and that the one-year-ahead expected inflation is generally higher, 
reflecting a higher inflation target relative to peers.

financial markets: 
less turbulence 
apart from a spike in volatility in august 2024, global 
financial markets remained relatively calm over the past 
six months, reflecting clearer inflation outcomes and 
less uncertainty about future interest rate paths. with 
the world’s major central banks finally in an easing cycle, 
equities trended higher and major yield curves shifted 
lower. risk assets generally performed well, aided by the 
dollar’s weakening on expectations of large cumulative fed 
rate cuts. in south africa, the post-election period was 
characterised by a broad-based rally in financial markets. 
the rand appreciated strongly and has maintained a firmer 
bias, supporting the disinflation process. meanwhile, the 
local currency bond curve has shifted lower, with yields on 
longer-dated bonds declining the most. this positive 
sentiment, alongside cooling inflation and the 25 basis 
point cut at the september mpc meeting, has led markets 
to price in further rate cuts over the next few quarters.
expectations realign
following significant volatility in 2023 and earlier this year, 
financial markets have calmed over the past six months as 
market and rate-setter expectations have broadly aligned. all 
the major global central banks, except for the bank of japan 
(boj), are now in an easing cycle. the ecb, the first among 
the major central banks to cut rates, moved in june this year 
with a 25 basis point reduction, followed by another cut of 
a similar magnitude in september, while the boe trimmed 
by 25 basis point in august and paused in september. 10 
the fed finally joined the ecb and boe in september when 
it reduced the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. with 
the rate adjustments largely priced in, markets exhibited 
little volatility. financial markets also responded positively 
to moves at the end of september by the pboc to initiate 
stimulus measures and announce a cut to its seven-day 
reverse repo to prop up the economy.
market-implied rate expectations suggest the fed will cut 
rates by a further cumulative 200 basis points by december 
2025, with around 80 basis points thereof expected to be 
cut before the end of this year. the easing of policy by the 
fed reflects stronger conviction that inflation will continue to 
moderate, as shown by the september ‘dot-plot’ marking 
the federal funds rate at about 4.4% by year-end, and 3.4% 
by the end of 2025. for the ecb and boe, rates are expected 
to decline by around 150 basis points within a year.
10 by contrast, the bank of japan (boj) hiked interest rates for a second 
time in july and further amended the parameters of its bond purchase 
programme in a move to scale back some of its stimulus measures 
that had lasted for more than a decade.

financial conditions have loosened significantly, reflecting 
eased pressures in money markets as well as debt and equity 
markets.11 a shift lower in global policy rates has impacted 
flow dynamics in financial (especially bond) markets. yield 
curves in the us, uk and germany steepened, reflecting lower 
short-term interest rates. in particular, the spread between the 
10- and 2-year us yields, which had been trading in negative 
territory for at least two years, turned positive as short-term 
yields declined.
major equity bourses rose strongly in response to recent policy 
easing by the fed and pboc. emerging market debt portfolio 
flows have also strengthened compared with the previous 
six months, notwithstanding the still elevated risks related to 
geopolitical tensions. however, investors remain selective. 
for instance, while south africa’s bond yield curve has 
shifted lower over the past six months, brazil’s has shifted 
upwards to reflect elevated inflation pressures and ongoing 
fiscal concerns.
volatility subsides but markets on edge
despite the apparent calmness, recent events suggest that 
markets remain on edge. markets experienced an episode 
of heightened volatility at the start of august following 
the publication of disappointing us jobs market data that 
triggered a spike in recession fears. equity markets sold off, 
with the impact exacerbated by the hawkishly-interpreted boj 
commentary that led to the unwinding of yen-funded carry 
trade positions. however, pullbacks were short-lived. investors 
repositioned portfolios rather than closing them entirely. also, 
economic data pointed to a us economy that was cooling 
as opposed to one headed into recession, again dampening 
market reactions.
currency markets have also adjusted in response to the 
increasing clarity about the trajectory for inflation, growth and 
policy rates. with interest rates in the us expected to decrease, 
the us dollar depreciated to lows last seen in the third quarter 
of 2023. the weaker dollar has generally supported currencies 
globally, with some exceptions and not without some currency 
volatility. emerging and advanced economies bucking the 
trend of lower inflation have seen further currency weakness, 
while other economies that are moving in the same direction 
have seen stronger outcomes. the rand has made the best 
of the weaker us dollar, being the third-best performing 
emerging market currency after the malaysian ringgit and thai 
baht over the past six months. the offshore chinese yuan 
also appreciated against the greenback to levels last seen in 
may 2023. by contrast, latin american currencies such as the 
mexican and argentinian pesos and brazilian real have come 
under pressure given the sensitivity to us rate differentials for 
the former and a mix of lower commodity prices and fiscal 
concerns weighing on the latter two.

october 2024
going forward, expectations are that most emerging market 
central banks will lower interest rates further but by less 
than the fed, implying widening interest rate differentials. in 
turn, these differentials should support further carry-trade 
flows, propping up emerging market currencies. 12 markets, 
nonetheless, will remain responsive to macroeconomic risks, 
especially for economies with elevated debt levels. the focus 
will remain on factors that could interfere with the directions 
expected by investors, in particular the upcoming us elections 
in november. 
south african financial 
market developments
the past six months saw a marked turnaround in the 
performance of domestic financial assets. a combination of 
improved global risk appetite and the unwinding of the political 
risk premium embedded in local assets has buoyed domestic 
financial markets. the rand outperformed most emerging 
market currencies, appreciating by 8.8% since the time of the 
previous mpr and by 5.9% on a year-to-date basis.13
yields on local currency government-issued instruments 
declined across the term structure, with those in the belly 
and long-end of the bond curve declining by nearly 200 basis 
points. the spread between the 3-year and 30-year south 
african government bonds fell below 300 basis points for 
the first time since june 2023, implying a flatter yield curve 
and a moderation in borrowing costs across the economy. a 
narrower country risk premium and lower inflation expectations 
renewed demand for rand assets by non-resident investors, 
further pushing yields down. maintaining progress on inflation 
and growth as well as reducing the borrowing needs of the 
public sector, could cheapen financing further, given the still 
low level of non-resident investment in the country (currently 
holding a low 24.6% of outstanding government bonds). on 
a year-to-date basis, non-resident investors have bought a 
cumulative (net) total of r36.9 billion worth of south african 
government bonds, compared with net sales of r8.8 billion in 
the same period last year.
south african equities have also outperformed both developed 
markets and emerging markets since april. despite heightened 
local market volatility in the period leading up to the election, 
south african equities rallied following the formation of the 
gnu. the jse all share index rose 13.2% from april to reach 
a record high of 84 553 index points. south african markets 
performed even better in dollar terms. the msci south africa 
index has increased by 13.5% since april compared with gains 
12 the institute of international finance noted in its september capital flows 
tracker report that lower us rates can reduce the cost of borrowing in 
dollars, which in turn may ease funding conditions for emerging markets 
and further support investment flows.
13 emerging market currencies have on aggregate depreciated by 3.9% on a 
year-to-date basis but performance has been almost flat since the last 
mpr.

of 5.5% for the broad msci emerging market (em) benchmark 
and 6.9% for the broad msci developed market (dm) index. 
however, jse sector performance was mixed, with the 
financial and banking indices up by 29% and 31% respectively 
(record highs) while the resources and mining indices declined 
by 2.2% and 4.0% respectively, with industrials in between.
the government issued two new bonds on 10 september 
2024, namely the r2033 and r2038, maturing on 31 march 
2033 and 31 march 2038 respectively. these bonds have 
lowered the average maturity of the bond curve from 16.8 
years to 14.9 years while smoothing out the redemption profile. 
both were offered at r1.25 billion and they cleared close to the 
interpolated market rates.14 
regarding market operations, the implementation of the new 
gfecra framework, along with the transfer of the funds to 
national treasury, resulted in the surplus liquidity level doubling 
to r160 billion over the review period. with market conditions 
improving generally, there were no distortions observed in 
price formation in money markets and in the funding behaviour 
of banks in the secured and unsecured interbank market. 
overnight call deposit rates for large corporate clients and 
funding rates in the foreign exchange (fx) forward market have 
been little changed. 
domestic policy rate expectations have evolved in a similar 
fashion to those observed in offshore markets, where central 
banks have either cut or are expected to cut interest rates. 
in south africa, policy rate expectations implied from forward 
rate agreements (fras) indicate one more repo rate cut of 
25 basis points for 2024 following the cut at the september 
2024 mpc meeting. this is a noticeable shift in expectations 
since the previous mpr , but not out of line with changes in 
south africa’s macroeconomic outlook.
14 interpolation is achieved by using other established bonds yields that are 
in sequence with the unknown bond. it is used to estimate the potential 
yield of a security.

real economy: smoother sailing?
the domestic economy grew by 0.5% year on year in the 
first half of this year. household spending and government 
consumption both supported growth while investment 
contracted. the high prevalence of load-shedding in the first 
quarter and logistical bottlenecks constrained economic 
activity greatly. going forward, output is expected to expand at 
a progressively increasing pace as the economy’s productive 
potential gradually lifts. the much improved electricity supply, 
declining inflation and interest rates as well as the pension 
withdrawals are among the factors supporting growth from 
the second half of this year. real gdp growth is projected to 
average 1.1% this year up from 0.7% in the previous year, rising 
to 1.8% by the end of the forecast period. further progress in 
the implementation of structural reforms, alongside sustaining 
the financing gains explored in the previous chapter, would 
continue to help improve the growth trajectory of the economy. 
recent economic developments
the south african economy grew by 0.5% year on year in the 
first six months of 2024 as the weak growth momentum from 
the past year carried over into the current year. 15 electricity 
supply inadequacies, along with logistical bottlenecks, were 
a binding constraint over the past year, severely limiting 
economic activity. while electricity supply has registered a 
remarkable improvement from the second quarter of this 
year, with load-shedding suspended for over six months and 
counting, this improvement is yet to fully reflect in economic 
activity. the slow pick-up in activity reflects various factors, 
including subdued sentiment by both households and firms, 
high costs of production as well as weak domestic and 
global demand. 16 other network industry challenges as well 
as possible scarring caused by the prolonged constraints to 
investment in productive capacity have also acted as drags to 
activity expansion.
at the broad sector level, the strength of economic activity 
was mixed. the primary sector contracted by 4.1%, reflecting 
poor outcomes in the agricultural and mining sectors. the 
el niño-induced mid-summer drought reduced summer grains 
and oilseed production, while mining production suffered from 
logistics and falling prices.17 
15 on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy recorded no growth in the 
first quarter, followed by a modest rebound of 0.4% in the second quarter.

the secondary sector also subtracted from gdp growth over 
the review period. this is despite all the subsectors growing in 
the second quarter, with construction posting its first expansion 
since the first quarter of 2023.
the tertiary sector, which grew by 1.4% year on year in the 
first six months of this year, underpinned domestic economic 
growth during the period. finance, which accounts for nearly 
a quarter of total gdp, was the bright spot, contributing 
0.7 percentage points to growth on an annual basis. however, 
the trade sector contracted – consistent with the muted 
sentiment by new vehicle dealers and furniture retailers. 18 
constrained real disposable income, along with elevated 
borrowing costs during the first half of the year, mostly explains 
the poor performance.
despite a generally weak economic environment the 
economy continued to create employment opportunities. total 
employment grew by 2.7% in the first half of this year compared 
with the same period in 2023. the rise in employment despite 
very muted gdp growth (0.5%) attests to south africa’s high 
growth elasticity of employment and suggests significant 
scope to reduce unemployment should economic growth rise 
appreciably on a sustained basis. the sarb expects further 
gains in employment over the medium term as business 
sentiment and economic growth benefit from the relaxation of 
supply-side constraints.
real household spending growth was subdued in the first six 
months of this year, increasing by just 0.4% on an annual basis. 
the outlook for household spending has improved, however, 
with consumer confidence edging higher in both the second 
and third quarters of this year. indeed, consumer confidence 
is at its highest in five years, indicating some optimism on the 
back of easing inflation and the anticipation of further interest 
rate relief.19 
in contrast to the household sector, investment disappointed 
hugely, with real total gross fixed capital formation (gfcf) 
falling by 5.2% year on year in the first half of this year. 
indeed, investment spending by all organisations is still below 
pre-pandemic levels. while private investment, the largest 
component of gfcf, benefitted significantly from embedded 
generation-related spending amid high levels of load-shedding 
over the past two years, activity in this market has slowed 
sharply. this likely reflects a slower approval process for 
projects as well as improved grid stability. meanwhile, public 
sector capital spending continues to be weighed down by the 
fragile positions of state-owned enterprises combined with 
underspending on capital projects due to governance and 
capacity challenges in government.

on the whole, while the economy expanded in the first six 
months of the year, the growth rate remains low. however, 
slightly better growth is expected in the second half of this year, 
in line with improved private sector sentiment, sustained gains 
in energy supply and stabilisation in ports and rail logistics.
growth outlook
the sarb’s baseline forecast projects economic activity to 
pick up over the medium term, underpinned by household 
spending and investment. various factors, including the 
two-pot retirement reform and higher real salaries as 
inflation moderates, should support household consumption 
(box 5). meanwhile, capital spending on embedded generation 
projects should remain supportive of gfcf over the forecast 
period considering the large project pipeline in the budget 
quotation phase. in addition, the somewhat improved terms of 
trade should help stabilise output in mining and the economy 
more broadly. the forecast, however, remains constrained 
by a modest potential growth rate, a result of the erosion of 
productive capacity over time reflected in very weak investment 
growth rates (box 4). 
by contrast, the domestic economic environment has improved 
significantly since the start of the second quarter of this year, 
reflecting the sustained electricity supply as well as a steady 
improvement in business sentiment and conditions following 
the formation of a gnu. load-shedding has been suspended 
since 26 march this year, while the energy availability factor 
(eaf) has risen closer to the desired 70% level. electricity supply 
should be further bolstered by new generating units (koeberg 
unit 2 and medupi unit 4) that are expected to come online 
over the coming months. accordingly, the sarb has adjusted 
its assumptions on load-shedding, which no longer detracts 
from gdp growth over the medium term. 20 the remaining 
0.1 percentage point loss pencilled in for 2024 is in stark 
contrast to the 0.6, 0.2 and 0.04 percentage point deductions 
projected in the april 2024 mpr . on the logistics front, the 
logistics crisis committee is expected to stabilise port and 
rail operations in the near term and to gradually improve their 
performance in the outer years of the forecast horizon. 21 
among the expenditure components, household consumption 
spending is projected to remain the main driver of growth over 
the medium term, underpinned by a strengthening household 
balance sheet and improved sentiment. real spending by 
households is forecast to grow by 1.0% in 2024 and by 1.6% 
in 2025 and 2026.
although investment is projected to contract this year, it is 
forecast to recover and contribute positively to growth in the 
outer years of the forecast period. the recovery will mainly 
be driven by increased capital spending on embedded 
generation projects, where plants with a combined capacity 
of approximately 10 gigawatt (gw) are expected to become 
20 some load-shedding is still expected but only at stages 1 and 2. 
the sarb assumes minimal to no adverse growth impacts from 
this level of load-shedding given the adaptations by industry.

commercially operational by the end of 2026. 22 moreover, 
the large number of projects in the budget quotation phase 
suggests that embedded generation will continue to underpin 
investment well beyond the current forecast horizon. the pace 
of investment, however, will be determined by grid access 
which appears to be a binding constraint, particularly in the 
provinces where most renewable generation is focused, 
namely the northern cape, eastern cape and western cape.23 
growth over the medium term will also benefit from the slightly 
improved terms of trade. south africa’s commodity export 
prices have deflated less than initially projected, while imports 
are softer. the higher trend for the terms of trade is projected 
to sustain over the forecast horizon.
consistent with the improved economic environment, the 
sarb revised its real gdp growth projection slightly higher to 
1.6% (1.4% in the april mpr) and 1.8% (1.6%) in 2025 and 2026 
respectively. potential output is also revised higher to 1.4% 
(1.2%) and 1.8% (1.6%) respectively over the same period. 
macro balances
current account and its drivers
as the economy slowed in the first half of 2024, the current 
account deficit narrowed to 1.2% of gdp from 1.8% of 
gdp in the first half of 2023. despite a larger deficit on the 
services, income and transfers (sit) account, the trade 
surplus increased as the terms of trade stabilised and imports 
remained muted. while the smaller current account deficit 
is not expected to persist as economic growth and import 
demand pick up, it should remain contained from modest 
government consumption and stronger exports. the current 
account deficit is now seen averaging 1.4% (2.1% in the april 
mpr) this year, deteriorating to 2.7% (3.3%) by 2026.
fiscal balances
despite economic conditions remaining subdued, the first 
five months of the 2024/25 fiscal year saw total main 
budget revenue increase sharply by 19.1% year on year. 
this improvement mostly reflected the gfecra windfall of 
r100 billion in july and august. 24 total gross tax collections, 
however, rose by only 4.3% over the same period, mainly 
driven by personal income tax (pit) revenue, while fuel, value-
added tax (vat) and corporate income tax (cit) weighed down 
total tax receipts.25

phase 1 review, pretoria: national treasury, 2024.
23 see d erasmus, ‘pipeline for grid-connected renewable energy 
project surges to 134gw’. businesslive, 25 august 2024.
24 excluding the gfecra distribution, main budget revenue 
increased by only 3.6% in the first five months of 2024/25. see 
national treasury, ‘statement of the national government’s 
revenue, expenditure and borrowing’. media release, 
30 september, pretoria: national treasury, 2024.
25 personal income tax (pit) was boosted by salary increases and 
bonus payments, while the decline in corporate income tax 
(cit) likely reflects reduced mining sector profitability. a decline 
in fuel receipts may reflect the reduced fuel consumption due 
to the suspension of load-shedding. finally, net value-added 
tax (vat) receipts were weighed down by higher refunds.

government spending has remained relatively contained year 
to date, consistent with the articulated fiscal consolidation 
framework. the main budget expenditure rose by a modest 
4.3% in the first five months of the current fiscal year, in part 
reflecting reduced debt-service costs. the current revenue 
and expenditure trends are consistent with the projected 
primary surplus of 0.8% of gdp in 2024/25, which is double 
that achieved in 2023/24.
however, the forecasted fiscal position is not without risks. 
financial challenges in critical state entities may warrant fiscal 
support, while an above-inflation public sector wage increase 
during the upcoming negotiations may add to spending 
pressures.26 on the revenue side, low profitability in the mining 
sector, along with slower economic growth, could drive 
revenue shortfalls.
conclusion 
the marked improvement in grid stability, along with the 
upbeat sentiment following the formation of the gnu, should 
improve near-term economic outcomes. activity should 
be further buoyed by the recovery in demand on the back 
of easing financial pressures on households and better 
investment prospects. accordingly, the economy is forecast to 
expand by 1.1% in 2024, rising to 1.8% by 2026. these growth 
projections, however, remain sensitive to further progress in 
the implementation of structural reforms in the energy and 
logistics sectors.

box 4 slow-fading scars
large economic shocks raise or lower economic output and can shift 
its rate of growth. in most cases output returns to its previous level and 
trend growth rate once the shock dissipates. however, some shocks 
can result in a permanent loss of economic output and a persistent 
change in the growth rate. 1 have the large adverse shocks to hit the 
south african economy in recent years – the covid-19 pandemic, 
electricity load-shedding, logistical bottlenecks, july 2021 unrest and 
floods in kwazulu-natal in 2022 – scarred the economy and caused 
permanent output losses that cannot be reversed? 
comparing actual output growth to the output that would have 
prevailed had the shock not occurred suggests a significant loss and 
a persistent decline in the economy’s productive potential. 2 to return 
to the counterfactual gdp level by the end of 2026, the economy 
would need to grow at 3.2% annually on average – more than double 
the 1.4% annual average growth rate currently projected.
the prospects for recovering from economic scarring would improve 
with a sustained increase in investment. to date, total real gross fixed 
capital formation remains well below its pre-covid level and real net 
investment has declined progressively over the past decade.3
the energy- and logistics-intensive sectors such as manufacturing 
and mining, along with construction, show large and persistent real 
output losses following a temporary rebound in 2021, remaining 9.0%, 
6.0% and 26% below 2019 levels respectively. manufacturing and 
mining output will need to grow at an annual average rate of 3.2% 
and 4.2% respectively to converge back to the counterfactual gross 
value-added level over the forecast horizon. 
the economy’s growth potential is projected to average 1.4% over 
the forecast horizon against a steady-state potential growth rate of 
2.5%. this compares poorly to south africa’s emerging market trading 
partners, whose potential growth estimates range between 2.0% and 
6.5% over the same period.

box 5 two-pot retirement reform: a shot in the arm 
for household spending1
south africa’s two-pot retirement savings reform allows employees to 
withdraw a portion (one-third) of their pension savings without having to 
resign first. from 1 september 2024, all retirement fund contributions 
are split between three components (or ‘pots’); namely the (i) vested 
component containing all accumulated retirement fund contributions 
made until 31 august 2024; 2 (ii) savings component containing 
one-third of all net annual retirement contributions made after the 
implementation date, including the once-off seed capital transfer from 
the vested component;3 and (iii) retirement component containing the 
remaining two-thirds of all net annual retirement contributions made 
after the implementation date.4 
in the short term, pension fund withdrawals are expected to boost 
household real disposable income and thus consumption. two 
possible withdrawal scenarios are considered here. 5 the high 
withdrawal scenario assumes an additional pre-tax r100 billion will 
be withdrawn in the fourth quarter of 2024, followed by withdrawals of 
r40 billion per annum thereafter. in the moderate withdrawal scenario 
(more likely), a pre-tax withdrawal of r40 billion in the fourth quarter of 
2024 is assumed and r20 billion per annum thereafter.
the overall economic impact of the new pension reform is sensitive to 
the size of the aggregate withdrawal. under a high withdrawal scenario, 
consumption increases significantly, rising by 0.8 and 1.8 percentage 
points in 2024 and 2025 respectively before reverting to the baseline 
(pre-two-pot retirement impact). spurred by stronger household 
spending, gross domestic product (gdp) growth edges higher by 0.3 
and 0.7 percentage points respectively over the same periods, before 
returning to the baseline in 2026. unsurprisingly, in an environment of 
constrained supply, the stronger demand lifts inflation, which rises by 
0.2 and 0.3 percentage points in 2025 and 2026 respectively relative 
to the baseline. the rise in inflation triggers a repurchase (repo) rate 
response, with the repo rate increasing by 0.6 and 0.9 percentage 
points in 2025 and 2026 respectively relative to the baseline to prevent 
the inflation impulse from entrenching – impacting the cost of capital to 
firms and borrowing costs for households.
a smaller increase in real household spending and gdp growth is 
anticipated in the moderate withdrawal scenario, with gdp growth 
only gaining 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points in 2024 and 2025 
respectively.6 this scenario has more muted inflationary impacts, with 
headline inflation ticking up by about 0.1 percentage points in both 
2025 and 2026. accordingly, the repo rate response is also muted, at 
0.2 and 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026 respectively.
in both scenarios the growth benefits are temporary while the inflation 
impacts appear to linger. while the two-pot retirement reform provides 
some short-term relief to distressed consumers, there are potential 
downsides. first, should the withdrawal rates turn out to be much 
higher, the rise in inflation would be substantial, potentially requiring a 
commensurate policy response. such an outcome would undermine 
both household consumption and corporate investment in the near 
to medium term, weighing on economic activity. second, the higher 
the withdrawal rates the less funds will be available at retirement age, 
implying lower household consumption in the longer run. relatedly, 
the reduced total saving would, other things being equal, raise the 
cost of capital and depress investment and ultimately the economy’s 
productive capacity in the medium to long run.

price developments: 
resetting the anchor
after remaining sticky in the 5–6% range for much of the 
review period, headline inflation declined to 4.4% in august 
2024. the softer reading marks the first time in over three 
years that headline inflation fell below the target midpoint. with 
oil prices lower and the rand strengthening, falling fuel prices 
have played a critical role in pulling headline inflation down. 
other major components of the consumer price inflation (cpi) 
basket have also slowed, including, importantly, food price 
inflation and imported goods prices. the sarb now expects 
headline inflation to average 4.6% this year, down from 5.1% in 
the april mpr. going forward, in the absence of upside risks 
materialising, headline inflation is forecast to undershoot the 
target midpoint through to 2026. 
oil prices and fuel inflation
despite some volatility, particularly in the earlier months of the 
review period, brent crude oil prices have largely supported 
domestic disinflation. after surging to us$90 per barrel in 
april 2024 as heightened geopolitical tensions in the middle 
east increased supply constraint fears, oil prices moderated 
as fears of a larger conflagration subsided. more recently, 
downgrades to future global growth rates have caused 
oil prices to soften further , averaging us$74 per barrel in 
september 2024 despite opec+ members (members of the 
organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) 
plus other oil-producing countries) extending their voluntary 
production cuts. over the review period, brent crude oil 
prices have averaged us$84 per barrel. the beneficial 
impact of softer oil prices has been accentuated by the recent 
strengthening of the rand, resulting in successive months of 
fuel price reductions and thus easing fuel price inflation. 
according to the us energy information administration (eia), 
the oil market is currently undersupplied by about a million 
barrels a day. voluntary production cuts by opec+ members 
have been kept in place, providing support to prices despite 
broadly weaker demand for oil, exemplified by modest growth 
in china, the world’s largest oil importer.26 in the medium term, 
supply and demand in the oil market is expected to remain 
relatively tight, keeping the forecast assumption for brent 
crude oil prices at an average of us$83 per barrel this year 
and us$81 per barrel over the medium term.
administered price inflation
in line with historical trends, administered price inflation 
continues to exert upward pressure on headline inflation. 
administered price inflation has averaged 7.6% year to date and

is projected to average 5.9% for the whole year. the trajectory 
for administered price inflation is primarily shaped by electricity 
price inflation. for instance, electricity has contributed almost 
half ( 3.2 percentage points ) of the year-to-date administered 
headline number, much higher than its relative weight of 22.1% 
in the administered prices basket.
electricity prices have risen by an average of 12.1% per year 
since 2009, against a rise of 5.3% per year for headline inflation 
over the same period. this sharp rise in electricity prices is 
meant to bring them to more cost-reflective levels to increase 
supply. electricity price inflation is forecast to average 13.6% 
this year before slowing to an average of 9.0% by the end of 
the review period, in line with municipal budget projections. 
considering the annual increases (july/august of the current 
year to june the following year), electricity price inflation 
moderated to 11.5% in august from 15.3% the year before.
in recent years, eskom’s revenue applications have been above 
20.0%, with the approved tariff increases markedly above 
the midpoint of the 3–6% inflation target band. this trend is 
expected to continue and, given its large weight of nearly a 
quarter of the administered price basket, presents risks to the 
administered inflation outlook.
fuel price inflation, projected at 0.6% again this year, will once 
more support a slower rise in administered price inflation. 
however, this muted fuel inflation mostly reflects the moderation 
in the basic fuel price (bfp), a component determined by the 
brent crude oil price and the rand exchange rate – which are 
wholly determined by market forces (the truly administered 
components in the fuel price basket include fuel taxes, levies 
and margins). if the bfp is excluded from fuel price inflation, 
administered price inflation is markedly higher at 7.5% in 2024. 
meanwhile, inflation for water tariffs and assessment rates has 
trended lower. water tariffs eased by 2.1 percentage points to 
7.5% this year. assessment rates also moderated, coming in at 
5.0% in august (compared with 8.4% the year before).
given the ‘indexation’ of most administered costs to headline 
inflation, the easing trend for headline inflation bodes well for 
administered price inflation going forward. 27 lower headline 
inflation should lead to a decline in administered price inflation, 
in turn reinforcing the downward shift in headline inflation in a 
virtuous cycle. 28 sarb projections are for administered price 
inflation to average 5.1% (3.1% if electricity is excluded) over 
the forecast horizon.

food and non-alcoholic 
beverages inflation
food and non-alcoholic beverages (nab) inflation eased over 
the past six months, reflecting favourable conditions at home 
and abroad. the containment of avian influenza (bird flu) and 
foot and mouth disease, a stronger rand exchange rate and the 
absence of load-shedding have all helped ease domestic price 
pressures, while the deflationary global agricultural commodity 
prices added further disinflationary impetus. food and nab 
inflation slowed to 4.7% in august 2024 from 5.1% in march 
this year. 
the decline in food inflation over the past year was broad-
based. by august 2024, 46.2% of the food basket inflated at 
rates below the target midpoint, up from 15.4% a year earlier. 
however, food inflation appears to have bottomed out as it 
ticked up marginally in august 2024.
food inflation has benefitted from lower price increases for 
meat, vegetables as well as milk, eggs and cheese. meat 
supply has improved mainly on increased slaughter activity, 
along with the containment of the bird flu in poultry. the foot 
and mouth disease in cattle has also largely been contained. 
at the same time, the suspension of load-shedding has 
reduced the spoilage in milk, eggs and cheese, while 
enabling irrigation and thus increased supply of vegetables. 29 
although meat inflation is expected to edge slightly higher 
in the coming months, it is only projected to average 1.2% 
this year. however, bread and cereals inflation has been 
climbing in recent months following a sharp jump in white 
maize spot prices amid concerns over possible drought-
related shortages. 30 this rise follows a 13-month deceleration 
streak through to may of this year, where inflation for this 
category bottomed at 3.9%. the sarb expects inflation 
for vegetables, milk, eggs and cheese as well as bread and 
cereals to average 4.8%, 7.4% and 5.3% respectively in 2024.
food and nab inflation has been downwardly revised to 
4.7% in 2024 (5.5% in the april mpr ). while near-term price 
pressures are anticipated due to the el niño-induced summer 
drought, the prospect of a return to wetter la niña conditions 
during the 2024–25 summer crop season should keep food 
price pressures contained.
29 vegetables inflation slowed to 4.4% in august 2024 from a peak 
of 23.6% in october 2023.
30 the white and yellow maize harvest for the 2023–24 season is estimated 
at 6.1 million and 6.7 million tonnes respectively, a decrease of 28.5% 
and 15.2% respectively when compared with the previous season.

core inflation 
south africa’s core inflation remained well contained through 
the pandemic inflation surge, averaging 0.3 percentage points 
above the target midpoint at its peak (both in 2022 and 2023). 
the relatively contained core inflation during the height of the 
global inflation surge countered the upward price pressures 
from the sharply higher food and fuel price increases, mitigating 
the acceleration of overall headline inflation. owing to muted 
core inflation, headline inflation peaked at 7.8%, while many 
emerging markets saw inflation reach double digits. indeed, 
south africa fared better even against the major advanced 
economies such as the us, eurozone and uk where headline 
inflation peaked in the 9–11% range. 
year to date, core inflation has averaged 4.6%, with the 
past three outcomes at, or below, the midpoint. core goods 
inflation has decelerated markedly over the past six months, 
pulling down on core inflation . despite some volatility earlier in 
the year, services price inflation also slowed in recent months, 
assisting the decline in core inflation. along with easing core 
inflation, the other measures of underlying inflation, namely 
trimmed mean inflation, supercore inflation and the persistent 
and common component of inflation (pcci), also point to 
softening inflation pressures. this indicates that demand and 
supply have been brought into better balance, thanks to a 
moderately restrictive monetary policy stance along with the 
dissipation of some supply shocks (box 6). projections are for 
core price inflation to undershoot the target midpoint from this 
year through to 2026.
since it peaked at 6.6% in august 2023, core goods inflation 
has decelerated sharply, shaving off 3.2 percentage points 
over the year to august 2024. core goods inflation has 
benefitted from softening global goods inflation a nd a 
stronger rand exchange rate over the review period, along 
with base effects.

despite some setbacks, services inflation also generally eased. 
while some large-weight components of the services basket 
such as medical insurance inflation have normalised to pre-
pandemic levels, others continue to play catch-up. housing, 
a big-ticket item, has continued to surprise to the downside 
(2.9% in august 2024, against the sarb’s expectation of 
3.4%). nevertheless, the sarb expects housing inflation to 
increase in line with the projected expansion in economic 
activity and a relatively tight rental market (box 7). services 
price inflation is forecast higher at 4.7% this year, up from 
4.2% in 2023 but to slightly undershoot the target midpoint 
in the outer years of the forecast, reflecting subdued inflation 
expectations and ulcs.

medium-term inflation outlook
within the qpm, the medium-term inflation outlook is 
determined by inflation expectations, the output gap, exchange 
rate gap and ulcs.
inflation expectations dynamics feed into inflation by serving 
as a gauge for both price and wage setters in the economy. 31

midpoint
after peaking at 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023, the bureau 
for economic researc h’s (ber) two-ye ars-ahead surveyed 
expectations have moderated for three consecutive quarters 
to reach a multi-year low of 4.8% in the third quarter of this 
year.32 nevertheless, surveyed expectations remain above the 
sarb’s preferred 4.5% midpoint, indicating that the goal of 
lowering and anchoring expectations at the midpoint is not 
yet complete.
the output gap, which captures the extent of demand 
pressures on inflation, is negative and wider in the near term, 
but closes by the end of the forecast period. the negative 
output gap is consistent with the projected undershoot in 
core inflation. the closing output gap towards the end of 
the forecast period reflects declining inflation, along with 
the expected further policy easing, that provides a lift to 
household and investment spending.
medium-term inflation dynamics are also shaped by 
movements in the rand exchange rate, which can raise 
or lower the impact of imported inflation on headline. 
the rand appreciated over the review period, as reflected 
in the improved starting point for the rand to the us dollar 
(r18.04 at the september 2024 mpc meeting compared 
with r18.88 at the march mpc meeting). 33 despite the strong 
showing in recent weeks, the rand is projected to depreciate 
slightly (0.8%) over the medium term, falling to an average 
of r18.19 by the fourth quarter of 2026. meanwhile, the real 
rand exchange rate, with a starting point undervaluation of 
2.4%, is expected to be inflationary but progressively less 
so as the undervaluation shrinks, resulting in a marginal 
overvaluation of 0.4% by the final quarter of the forecast 
period. the improvement in the real rand should help mitigate 
some imported inflationary pressures. 
the labour market has continued to surprise on the downside, 
with wage growth not matching the sarb’s expectations of 
backward indexation. this may reflect the weakness in the 
labour market, where employment growth has been muted due 
to weak economic activity. over the medium term, productivity 
is expected to rise at a faster pace than real wages, in line 
with the projected stronger gdp growth; hence, the ulc gap 
is forecast to remain negative throughout the forecast period. 
nominal ulc growth is also forecast to undershoot the target 
midpoint, averaging 3.5% over the forecast horizon, lending 
further support to lower inflationary pressures. 34
32 two-years-ahead inflation expectations averaged 5.2% and 4.9% in 
the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively. however, the average 
expectations mask the wide dispersion across the different groups, 
with business expectations, at 5.2% in the third quarter, still way 
above the target midpoint.
33 see discussion in the financial markets chapter for the drivers 
of the rand appreciation.
34 nominal ulc growth determines whether inflationary pressures are the 
result of wage increases or productivity decreases. growth in real salaries 
is projected at 1.0% in 2024 from -1.3% in 2023, and to average 0.6% 
over the forecast period, while productivity growth is expected to rise to 
1.9% in 2024 from -0.3% in 2023, and to average 1.4% over 
the medium term .

conclusion
headline inflation decelerated strongly in recent months, with 
the latest outcome slightly undershooting the target midpoint. 
disinflation has benefitted from dissipating domestic cost 
shocks as well as the continued transmission of a moderately 
restrictive monetary policy stance. over the medium term, 
core inflation is expected to remain muted amid subdued 
wage pressures, easing inflation expectations and a relatively 
strong rand exchange rate. the qpm baseline projection 
indicates an undershoot of the target midpoint in both 2025 
and 2026. risks to this inflation outlook are assessed to 
be balanced.
box 6 supply shocks ‘under the hood’ of personal 
consumption inflation 
between october 2023 and july of this year headline inflation 
averaged 5.4% before decreasing by a full percentage point, dropping 
just below the target midpoint in august. key to understanding 
the effectiveness of monetary policy is getting a clear sense of the 
demand and supply sources of inflation. this box decomposes 
south africa’s personal consumption expenditure (pce) inflation 
(the prices paid for goods and services consumed by households) 
into its demand and supply drivers following the methodology of 
shapiro (2022).1 
pce inflation rose sharply in 2022, peaking at 8.1% in the fourth 
quarter of that year. the surge in inflation is generally attributed to 
a recovery in demand and multiple, large and often overlapping 
global and domestic supply shocks. 2 since the highs of 2022, 
inflation showed considerable inertia, only slowly returning to the 
4.5% target midpoint. 
the decomposition shows that the demand-driven component of 
pce inflation returned closer to pre-pandemic levels this year and 
is not the main reason for slower disinflation. rather, the slower 
remission of supply shocks mostly explains the relative stickiness in 
inflation over the past year, as reflected in the still elevated supply-
driven component of pce inflation. 
the further unwinding of supply shocks provides impetus to the 
near- and medium-term disinflation seen in the current forecast. 
1 the personal consumption expenditure (pce) inflation decomposition 
entails running reduced-form vector autoregressions (vars) of price 
and quantity equations for each of the 22 pce categories and using the 
residuals to classify inflation in each category as demand- or supply-driven. 
see a shapiro, ‘decomposing demand- and supply-driven inflation’, 
federal reserve bank of san francisco working paper series 2022(18) , 
san francisco: federal reserve bank of san francisco, october 2022.
2 global supply chain disruptions were exacerbated by russia’s invasion of 
ukraine and further worsened by geopolitical tensions, especially in the 
middle east. domestic supply shocks included load-shedding, el niño, 
animal disease outbreaks and a sharply depreciated currency.

box 7 muted housing inflation but how sustainable? 
housing inflation in south africa has trended well below its long-
term average in recent years, averaging 2.7% in 2022 and 2023 
and 3.1% year to date. subdued housing inflation has helped to 
keep services and thus core inflation contained, easing pressures 
on headline inflation. meanwhile, homeownership costs have risen 
strongly in recent years, reflecting the large increases in municipal 
rates and taxes, other costs as well as interest rates. the rental 
market has also tightened sharply in the wake of the pandemic. 1 
these cost escalations and demand recovery do not appear to be 
reflected in housing inflation but suggest upside risks to this important 
component of consumer prices.
market indicators of rental escalations, including the payprop and 
tpn rental series, show rental inflation rising significantly after the 
pandemic. the divergence between the official and market measures 
of rental inflation presents upside risk of a catch-up over the medium 
term, considering their historically strong co-movement. indeed, over 
the past three years the sarb had expected rental inflation to return to 
its long-term average, but it has repeatedly surprised to the downside. 
one way of explaining this inconsistency between housing inflation 
and squeezed supply is that landlords are keeping prices low to 
increase occupancy rates, which may be a bigger priority at this 
juncture compared to cost recovery. but this raises questions 
about how sustainable such an approach is. how long will landlords 
continue to ‘subsidise’ tenants and take a lower return on their 
capital when vacancy rates are historically low and the rental market 
tight? equally, with stronger economic growth over the medium 
term, demand for rentals should rise and vacancy rates tighten 
further, turning it into a lessors’ market. in addition, the supply of 
rental housing units is unlikely to increase much over the near to 
medium term as activity in the residential building sector remains 
depressed.2 this constellation of factors may present an opportunity 
for landlords to escalate rentals markedly, both to balance supply 
and demand and to recoup lost earnings.
thus, despite the downside surprises to housing inflation over the 
past three years, risks remain tilted to the upside. materialisation 
of these risks could push core inflation higher and dent the recent 
easing trend for headline inflation, given the large weight of housing 
in the consumer price index (cpi) basket.
1 homeownership costs are composed of mortgage costs, cost of 
maintenance for the property along with property taxes, levies and 
insurance costs. mortgage repayments are up 39.8% while other 
homeownership costs have averaged about 8.6% between november 
2021 and may 2023. rental prices increased by a modest 3.7% on 
average over the same period. see s knox, m mofokeng and 
w simbanegavi, ‘a confluence of factors drives mortgage impairments 
higher’, economic note no. en/2024/114 , 
pretoria: , august 2024.
2 statistics south africa (stats sa) data show that both residential building 
plans passed and units completed recorded negative outcomes for 7 out 
of the past 10 quarters. see stats sa, ‘selected building statistics of the

conclusion
global inflation continues to moderate, suggestive of the 
final ebbing of the pandemic and the subsequent recovery. 
subdued inflation momentum, along with signs of cooling 
labour markets, has provided greater confidence to central 
banks that inflation will stabilise at targets. accordingly, major 
global central banks have begun normalising policy. 
however, the disinflation process has not been smooth, nor 
is it even complete. inflation remains above target in many 
countries and some central banks had to reverse their easing 
to deal with renewed inflationary pressures. in many places, 
underlying inflation – especially in services prices and wages – is 
proving resistant to further moderation, while some economies 
continue to experience robust consumption and economic 
growth despite elevated borrowing costs. accordingly, the pace 
and quantum of rate cuts over the coming year will continue 
to diverge across countries and regions. what appears to be 
common across both advanced and emerging economies is 
that central banks are moving carefully, and deliberately, as 
they look to incoming data to guide future policy direction. 
presently, data suggest relatively tight policy stances, but also 
that the room to manoeuvre with policy is limited.
assuming no major new shocks to the world economy, the 
disinflation process should gradually progress and monetary 
conditions ease further. the stickiness of core inflation, 
however, suggests that long-run neutral interest rates are 
unlikely to fall back to the levels they were before the pandemic. 
very high public debt levels, adverse demographics in much 
of the world and climate change all represent structural 
impediments to much lower neutral rates. geoeconomic 
fragmentation, driven by political contestation, presents 
large additional risks to capital flows, supply chains and 
trade. technological advances, propelled forward by artificial 
intelligence, and the need for cheaper renewable energy may 
offset or accentuate these pressures. 35 
with inflation risks on the global horizon, central banks and 
fiscal authorities will need more sustainable policy settings. 
governments and central banks need to create policy space 
(through fiscal consolidations and stabilising inflation at targets) 
to be able to support stronger growth over the medium to 
longer term. 
south africa’s inflation has softened in the past two months 
and the outlook has improved markedly. the rand appreciation 
has added impetus to the disinflation process, which had, 
until now, been driven by a moderately restrictive monetary 
policy stance, slowing global goods price increases and the 
subsidence of the various domestic idiosyncrasies such as 
load-shedding and animal diseases.
35 technological advances that raise the productivity 
of capital would imply higher neutral rates.
this confluence of favourable shocks has given the mpc 
greater confidence that inflation and inflation expectations 
will stabilise around the target midpoint. indeed, the qpm’s 
baseline forecast indicates a sustained undershoot of headline 
and core inflation as well as inflation expectations over the 
forecast period. with this backdrop, the mpc lowered the repo 
rate by 25 basis points in september 2024, leaving the policy 
stance still moderately restrictive. 
declining inflation coupled with the interest rate relief, two-
pot retirement reform and improved electricity supply, should 
bolster sentiment and spur growth in household spending 
and investment. while near-term growth remains muted, the 
economy is projected to expand at a somewhat faster pace 
in the outer years of the forecast as the drag from electricity 
supply is lifted and other supply-side bottlenecks become less 
binding. this, however, is premised on further progress on 
structural reforms.
as the energy constraint and logistical bottlenecks become 
less binding, the attention shifts to other constraints that 
depress business sentiment and hold back investment, and 
thus growth. long-term borrowing costs remain high, mostly 
reflecting high public debt levels. further progress on fiscal 
consolidation would reduce corporate investment costs, 
minimise crowding-out of the private sector and create fiscal 
space to support public investment programmes. other 
actions that can support better growth outcomes include 
the better alignment of administered price increases with the 
projected low-inflation environment, ensuring that public sector 
real wages rise in line with productivity and progress in the 
implementation of broader structural reforms, including in 
education, water and electricity distribution.

issued by lesetja kganyago, governor of the , 
at a meeting of the monetary policy committee in pretoria
1 since the previous mpc, the rand has traded in a range of r19.32/us$ (april 19) to r18.05/us$ (may 22).
2 the rand is the third-best performing major emerging market currency for the period since the previous mpc. it is fifth for the year to date.
3 the july 2023 forecast had inflation at 4.5% by 2025q3. september 2023 forecasted it to be reached in 2025q2, which is the last time this was moved 
up. subsequently, november 2023 had it at 4.5% by 2025q3; january 2024 by 2025q3; and march 2024 by 2025q4.
4 headline inflation was 4.4% in april 2021 and 5.2% in may 2021. headline inflation has been above 4.5% for every subsequent print, a period of 
36 months.
5 the 2024q1 growth rate has been marked down to 0.2% from 0.4% quarter on quarter (q/q); at the same time, 2024q2 has been marked up, from 
0.4% to 0.7% q/q.
6 the number of load-shedding days has been reduced from 200 days to 180, where a day is 24 hours of load-shedding and not any calendar day with 
load-shedding. the projected cost to gdp from load-shedding for 2024 is down to 0.5 percentage points (pp), from 0.6pp in the march forecast, and 
declines to 0.2pp for 2025 and 0.04pp for 2026.
we had an uncertain start to 2024, but recently, 
developments have been somewhat more positive.
inflation outcomes were worse than expected early in the 
year, leading to a repricing of rate expectations. there is 
still considerable uncertainty about the longer-run inflation 
outlook, globally. that said, inflation outcomes in the united 
states (us) have been more benign recently and markets 
still see some room for adjustments by the us federal 
reserve this year. we may also see easing by other major 
central banks. 
meanwhile, oil prices are back to where they were at the 
start of the year, close to us$80 per barrel, after briefly 
exceeding us$90 per barrel. although geopolitical tensions 
are far from resolved, some of the more adverse economic 
scenarios, such as oil prices above us$100 per barrel, 
appear less probable now. our own forecast suggests oil 
prices will remain near their current levels. 
the exchange rate of the rand has been particularly volatile 
since the previous monetary policy committee (mpc) 
meeting.1 it briefly appreciated to a 10-month high against 
the us dollar last week. the starting point for our forecast is 
r18.57 against the us dollar.2 markets remain focused on 
the direction of domestic policy, a theme that has dominated 
many investor conversations over the past few months. 
conditions remain uncertain, but we expect greater clarity 
in due course. 
turning to the outlook, we now see inflation stabilising at 
our 4.5% target objective in the second quarter of next year. 
this is an improvement on our march forecast, which was to 
only reach this milestone at the end of 2025. the changes to 
the outlook, however, are not large when compared to our 
march forecast. average inflation for 2025 is only a 10th of 
a percentage point lower. the task of achieving our inflation 
objective is not yet done.3 
the change in our inflation forecast mostly reflects recent 
data outcomes, with the cpi releases for march and april 
turning out slightly better than expected. we have revised 
down our 2024 food and core forecasts marginally.
fuel price inflation is now expected to be higher, in the 
near term, but it improves for 2025. this helps our forecast 
to get to the target midpoint sooner.
nonetheless, the mpc remains concerned that inflation 
expectations are elevated. after three years 4 of inflation 
being above 4.5%, few survey respondents, especially from 
businesses and trade unions, now believe that inflation will 
be at 4.5% in two years’ time.
although the mpc assesses the inflation forecast risks to 
be broadly balanced at present, high inflation expectations 
require that we deliver on our target sooner rather than later 
in order to re-anchor expectations.
turning to the growth outlook, economic activity indicators 
for the first quarter have been coming in worse than 
expected, despite reduced electricity load-shedding. 
however, these higher-frequency data can be volatile. we 
expect slightly weaker first-quarter growth, but this will be 
offset by better second-quarter growth. 5 we still forecast 
gdp growth of 1.2% this year. the growth numbers for the 
outer years also remain unchanged.
we assess the risks to the growth outlook as balanced.
the recent improvement in the power supply, with no load-
shedding since 26 march, is a welcome development. we 
have revised our load-shedding assumption down, but 
additional revisions may be required if this performance 
is sustained.6 
overall, our forecasts show a modest acceleration in growth 
over the next few years, alongside a gradual stabilisation 
of inflation at our target. however, uncertainty is unusually 
elevated at the moment.

considering this outlook, the mpc decided to keep the repo 
rate unchanged at 8.25%. the decision was unanimous.
the forecast continues to see policy normalisation, with rates 
easing into more neutral territory by next year. as before, the 
rate path from the quarterly projection model (qpm) remains 
a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting. 
decisions of the mpc will continue to be data dependent 
and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. 
we are committed to stabilising inflation at the midpoint of 
the target band. achieving this outcome will improve the 
economic outlook and reduce borrowing costs.
finally, we reiterate the views of the committee on additional 
measures that would improve economic conditions. these 
include reaching a prudent public debt level, improving the 
functioning of network industries, lowering administered 
price inflation and keeping real wage growth in line with 
productivity gains.

notes
a. the nominal effective exchange rate (neer) is based on the bilateral exchange rates of south africa’s three largest trading partners (the eurozone, us and japan). the bilateral exchange rates are 
weighted by export trade weights. the implied starting point for the rand forecast is r18.57 to the us dollar.
b. the nominal exchange rate steady state is estimated using the purchasing power parity (ppp) condition, which links the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to the inflation differential 
between south africa and abroad. given that the real effective exchange rate (reer) depreciation is zero at steady state, the nominal exchange rate will therefore depreciate by 2.5% per year 
in steady state, reflecting the inflation (target) differential between domestic (4.5%) and foreign (2.0%) inflation.
c. the reer is the neer deflated by the consumer price differential between south africa and the trade-weighted cpi of the eurozone, us and japan.
d. the real exchange rate gap signifies the extent to which the real exchange rate deviates from its estimated equilibrium level. a positive gap shows an overvaluation of the currency and vice versa.
e. the unit labour cost (ulc) is the labour cost to produce one ‘unit’ of output. this is calculated as the total wages and salaries in the non-agricultural sector divided by the real value added at basic 
prices in the non-agricultural sector of the economy.
f. the repo rate at the end of the period refers to the average for the last quarter of the year. the nominal repo rate steady state is calculated as the sum of south africa’s inflation target (4.5%) 
and the steady-state neutral real interest rate (nrir) (2.5%).
g. the nrir is the policy rate minus inflation, which prevails when the economy is fully in balance, with inflation at target and output at potential. the policy stance 
is measured as either tight or loose based on whether actual rates are above or below this neutral rate respectively. the steady-state nrir is calculated as the sum of the respective steady 
states for the group of three (g3) nrir (0.5%), south africa’s risk premium (2.0%) and the change in the reer (0.0%). before the steady state is reached, it is possible for the reer equilibrium to 
appreciate or depreciate, so this value can have a non-zero value over the medium term. it is nonetheless always zero in the long run.
h. the steady state is the long-run value in the model. while model equilibriums can have different values over the medium term, as conditions change, all equilibriums eventually reach a steady 
state, where they stabilise.
i. the forecast of the current account balance is obtained from the sarb’s core macroeconometric model.

statement of the monetary policy committee
18 july 2024 
issued by lesetja kganyago, governor of the , 
at a meeting of the monetary policy committee in pretoria
1 for example, between april and may, euro area inflation rose to 2.6% from 2.5%. in brazil, inflation increased to 4.2% in june from 3.9% in may. 
2 the previous projection was for growth of 0.7%. 
3 the gdp impact of load-shedding in 2024 has been reduced to -0.2 percentage points (pp), from an estimated -0.5pp in the may forecast. it is -0.1pp 
for 2025 (compared with -0.2pp previously), and 0pp for 2026 (-0.04pp previously). this contrasts with an estimated -1.5pp for 2023. 
4 headline inflation is expected to average 4.8% in 2024q3 and 4.3% in 2024q4. 
5 the implied starting point was r18.60 in the may forecast. 
6 core inflation averages 4.6% for 2024, 4.4% for 2025 and 4.5% for 2026. 
7 market-based measures of inflation expectations have similar dynamics. these break-even rates have declined recently, but remain generally above 
the midpoint. shorter-term expectations (5 years) are at 4.6%; longer-term (10 year) expectations are at 5.7%. 
8 the quarterly projection model’s (qpm) forecast for two-years-ahead inflation expectations stabilises at 4.5% by 2025q1. 
as we move into the second half of the year, global inflation 
continues to ease. the very rapid price increases of 2022 and 
2023 have receded. however, inflation in most economies 
has yet to stabilise in line with targets. for example, in june, 
consumer price inflation was 3% in the united states (us), 
and 2.5% in the euro area, still above those economies’ 
2% targets. services and wage price inflation has proven 
stubborn, underpinned by resilient economic activity and 
low unemployment rates across major economies. 
clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won and for this 
reason global interest rates remain elevated. 
at the same time, there has been some policy divergence, 
which reflects different country circumstances. 
since our last meeting, policy rates were lowered in canada, 
switzerland and the euro area, but kept unchanged in the 
us, united kingdom (uk) and japan. among emerging 
markets, countries that have lowered inflation more, 
especially in latin america, have been able to cut policy 
rates more. a concern for central banks, however, is that 
lower inflation outcomes have not always been sustained .1 
turning to south africa, economic performance in the 
first half of the year was disappointing. the economy 
contracted slightly in the first quarter, by 0.1%, and recent 
data, including last week’s mining and manufacturing 
numbers, have caused us to trim our second quarter 
growth estimate modestly, to 0.6%.2 over the medium term, 
we expect somewhat faster growth, supported by a more 
reliable electricity supply and improving logistics, among 
other factors.3 our revised growth projections nonetheless 
remain below longer-run historical averages, of about 2%. 
the risks to this forecast are assessed as broadly balanced, 
with ample scope for structural reforms to lift growth further 
over the medium term. 
on the inflation front, the most recent headline print, for 
may, was 5.2%, unchanged from april and still in the top 
half of our target range. the outlook, however, has improved 
somewhat. headline consumer price inflation for this year is 
now projected at 4.9%, compared to 5.1% at the previous 
meeting.4 over the next few quarters, headline inflation is 
expected to dip below the 4.5% midpoint, mainly because 
of fuel and food prices. this outlook is supported by the 
stronger rand. the implied starting point for our forecast 
is r18.35 to the us dollar. 5 o v e r t h e m e d i u m t e r m , w e 
continue to see inflation stabilising at 4.5%, with core inflation 
remaining close to this midpoint objective throughout. 6
for inflation expectations, the latest survey results show 
average expectations at 5% next year and 4.9% two years 
ahead, still uncomfortably above the sarb’s 4.5% objective 
and above our own inflation forecasts. however, all categories 
of respondents lowered their inflation expectations from the 
previous survey.7 we anticipate further progress as inflation 
slows, helping to re-anchor expectations firmly at 4.5%. 8 
while the forecast has improved, the balance of risks is 
assessed to the upside. 
against this backdrop, the monetary policy committee 
(mpc) decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 8.25%. 
four members preferred an unchanged stance and two 
preferred a reduction of 25 basis points. 
in discussing the stance, mpc members agreed that 
restrictive policy remains appropriate to stabilise inflation at 
4.5%. the committee assessed that an unchanged stance 
remained appropriate, given the inflation risks. some 
members, however, were of the view that the inflation 
outlook had improved enough to reduce the degree of 
restrictiveness. 
42
october 202450
global interest rates remain high, especially in the us, 
and rates may stay higher for even longer than markets 
currently anticipate. this presents risks to the currency 
outlook. 
domestically, inflation expectations do not yet reflect the 
4.5% midpoint objective over the medium term. while 
expectations are moving in the right direction, they continue 
to show the impact of the recent inflation surge.
we remain concerned about administered prices. we have 
had to mark up electricity inflation for this forecast round 
even as other categories shifted lower. 
services price inflation also remains uncomfortably above 
the midpoint. 
the forecast continues to see rates easing into more 
neutral territory by next year. as before, the rate path from 
the quarterly projection model (qpm) remains a broad 
policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting.
decisions of the mpc will continue to be data dependent 
and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook.
we are committed to stabilising inflation at the midpoint of 
the target band. achieving this outcome will improve the 
economic outlook and reduce borrowing costs.
finally, we reiterate the views of the committee on additional 
measures that would improve economic conditions. these 
include reaching a prudent public debt level, improving the 
functioning of network industries, lowering administered 
price inflation and keeping real wage growth in line with 
productivity gains.

notes
a. the nominal effective exchange rate (neer) is based on the bilateral exchange rates of south africa’s three largest trading partners (the eurozone, us and japan). the bilateral exchange rates 
are weighted by export trade weights. the implied starting point for the rand forecast is r18.35 to the us dollar.
b. the nominal exchange rate steady state is estimated using the purchasing power parity (ppp) condition, which links the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to the inflation differential 
between south africa and abroad. given that the real effective exchange rate (reer) depreciation is zero at steady state, the nominal exchange rate will therefore depreciate by 2.5% per 
year in steady state, reflecting the inflation (target) differential between domestic (4.5%) and foreign (2.0%) inflation.
c. the reer is the neer deflated by the consumer price differential between south africa and the trade-weighted cpi of the eurozone, us and japan.
d. the real exchange rate gap signifies the extent to which the real exchange rate deviates from its estimated equilibrium level. a positive gap shows an overvaluation of the currency 
and vice versa.
e. the unit labour cost (ulc) is the labour cost to produce one ‘unit’ of output. this is calculated as the total wages and salaries in the non-agricultural sector divided by the real value added at basic 
prices in the non-agricultural sector of the economy.
f. the repo rate at the end of the period refers to the average for the last quarter of the year. the nominal repo rate steady state is calculated as the sum of south africa’s inflation target (4.5%) 
and the steady-state neutral real interest rate (nrir) (2.5%).
g. the nrir is the policy rate, minus inflation, which prevails when the economy is fully in balance, with inflation at target and output at potential. the policy stance is measured as either tight or loose 
based on whether actual rates are above or below this neutral rate respectively. the steady-state nrir is calculated as the sum of the respective steady 
states for the group of three (g3) nrir (0.5%), south africa’s risk premium (2.0%) and the change in the reer (0.0%). before the steady state is reached it is possible for the reer equilibrium to 
appreciate 
or depreciate, so this value can have a non-zero value over the medium term. it is nonetheless always zero in the long run.
h. the steady state is the long run value in the model. while model equilibriums can have different values over the medium term, as conditions change, all equilibriums eventually reach a steady 
state, where they stabilise.
i. the forecast of the current account balance is obtained from the sarb’s core macroeconometric model.

statement of the monetary policy committee
19 september 2024 
issued by lesetja kganyago, governor of the , 
at a meeting of the monetary policy committee in pretoria
1 for instance, headline inflation for august was 2.2%, in both the euro area and united kingdom (uk), and 2.5% for the us, all against targets of 2%.
2 the july forecast anticipated growth of 0.6% in 2024q2, versus an outcome of 0.4%. however, first-quarter growth was revised up to 0% from -0.1%, 
so the level of gdp was only 0.1% below our expectations in 2024q2.
3 this refers to the quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted measure. the year-on-year rates are 1.4% and 1.7% for 2024q3 and 2024q4 respectively.
4 the estimated gdp impact of load-shedding has been cut back to -0.13 percentage points (pp) for 2024 and 0pp for 2025 and 2026. this contrasts 
with -0.18pp, -0.05pp and 0pp for those years respectively as of the july monetary policy committee (mpc) meeting. the estimated 2023 impact is 
-1.5pp.
5 the starting point for the july forecast was r18.35 per us dollar.
6 housing inflation slowed unexpectedly, from 3.3% to 2.9%, in the june cpi. this item is surveyed quarterly.
as we move towards the end of the year, global inflation 
is slowing and nearing targets. 1 given these gains, major 
central banks have lowered rates. we saw the european 
central bank cut again last week, the bank of england 
eased in august and the united states (us) federal reserve 
reduced rates last night. the us dollar has also cooled off in 
recent months, providing some respite for other currencies, 
including the rand.
despite these welcome developments, central banks are 
moving carefully and policy stances remain relatively tight. 
economic activity in major economies has been resilient, 
even as inflation eases. underlying measures of inflation 
have also fallen less than headline, primarily because of 
elevated housing inflation and robust wage growth.
the case for caution is further bolstered by the difficult 
and unpredictable geopolitical environment, with risks of 
inflationary shocks through trade restrictions and supply 
chain disruptions, among other factors.
overall, global conditions have become more favourable, 
but there are still risks. a ‘soft landing’ is looking more likely 
after the worst inflation surge in a generation, but it is not 
inevitable. the financial market volatility of early august was 
a reminder of the fragilities and uncertainties in the system.
for these reasons, central banks are approaching the 
endgame with caution.
turning to south africa, output was marginally below 
our expectations for the first half of the year. 2 we expect 
improvements in the second half, with growth of 0.6% in 
both quarters. 3 this reflects rising confidence, in part due 
to a stable electricity supply. we also expect extra spending 
given the withdrawals from the new two-pot retirement 
system, although some of these funds will be absorbed by 
debt repayments and tax.
for the medium term, our growth projections have once 
again edged higher. the upgraded forecast is premised on 
better-functioning network industries, especially electricity, 
alongside broader reform momentum. 4 since potential 
growth is higher in the forecast, supply and demand remain 
broadly balanced, even as growth accelerates. the pace of 
growth nonetheless remains below longer-run averages of 
around 2%.
a particular concern is investment, which has been 
contracting for four consecutive quarters. a stronger 
investment performance is a prerequisite for sustained 
higher growth and, although we continue to expect an 
investment recovery, its scale and speed will be a key 
indicator of south africa’s longer-run economic prospects.
the risks to the growth outlook are assessed as balanced. 
moving to inflation, headline eased to 4.4% in august, a 
three-year low, and close to the middle of our target range. 
our forecast suggests this progress will be sustained, with 
inflation contained below the 4.5% midpoint of our range 
through to the end of the forecast horizon, in 2026.
in the near term, we continue to see a dip in headline 
inflation, supported by the stronger exchange rate and lower 
oil prices. the implied starting point of the rand is r18.04 to 
the us dollar, an appreciation of nearly 2% relative to our 
july assumption. 5 this contributes to fuel price deflation, 
which helps keep headline inflation below 4% through the 
first half of next year. as usual, we will look through this near-
term supply shock, focusing on the medium-term outlook.
lower headline inflation also reflects a better food price 
outlook, with inflation for this category below the midpoint 
through 2025 and 2026. however, these benefits are partly 
offset by higher electricity prices, with an expected inflation 
rate more than double that of headline.
for core inflation, we expect the trajectory to be slightly 
below 4.5% over the medium term. again, this is primarily 
due to the exchange rate, which affects core mainly through 
import prices.
services inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilise 
near the midpoint early next year, after a stretch of prints 
above 4.5%. this partly reflects subdued housing inflation, 
which has accelerated less than expected this year. 6 lower 
inflation expectations also contribute to the improved 
services outlook.
47
october 2024
according to the latest survey, these expectations are still 
in the top half of the target range, at 4.8% for both 2025 
and 2026.7 they are nonetheless moving – slowly – in the 
right direction. 8 as long as headline inflation stabilises at 
lower levels, we anticipate further progress in re-anchoring 
expectations around the middle of our target range. 9 
the risks to inflation are assessed as balanced.
against this backdrop, the mpc decided to reduce the 
policy rate by 25 basis points to 8% per annum, with effect 
from 20 september.
in discussing the stance, mpc members considered an 
unchanged stance, a 25 basis point cut and a 50 basis 
point cut. the mpc ultimately reached consensus on 
25 basis points, agreeing that a less restrictive stance 
was consistent with sustainably lower inflation over the 
medium term.
the forecast sees rates moving towards neutral next year, 
stabilising slightly above 7%. as before, the rate path from 
the quarterly projection model remains a broad policy guide, 
changing from meeting to meeting. decisions of the mpc 
will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the 
balance of risks to the outlook.
there are scenarios where inflation could undershoot the 
baseline forecast, if oil prices are lower or the exchange rate 
appreciates further. conversely, inflation could be higher 
than our baseline forecast given scenarios such as higher 
housing costs, larger electricity price increases, or wage 
increases that outrun inflation and productivity growth. 
meanwhile, food inflation is a source of uncertainty, despite 
recent improvements.
global conditions pose additional challenges. geopolitical 
risks are heightened and could generate further economic 
shocks. policy uncertainty is also elevated in various 
parts of the world. both trade restrictions and debt levels 
are rising and might go much higher. this mix could add 
significant inflationary pressure to the world economy, 
generating tighter financial conditions for south africa and 
other countries.
for the time being, south african assets have performed 
relatively well. the rand has strengthened during the year, 
more than most peer currencies, while long-term yields have 
moderated and spreads over us rates have narrowed. 10 
these moves have reversed some of the deterioration 
experienced since 2020.
7 market-based measures of inflation expectations have also moderated. since the previous mpc meeting, shorter-term expectations (5 years) have 
declined to 4.3%, while longer-term expectations (10 years) have fallen to 5.3%.
8 average expectations declined by 0.2pp for 2024 and 2025, and 0.1pp for 2026, in the third-quarter survey.
9 the forecast projects that two-years-ahead expectations will reach 4.4% in 2026, fractionally below the midpoint.
10 for instance, the yield on the r2035 bond have moved from about 11.4% at the start of 2024 to a peak of about 12.5% in april, and subsequently 
down to around 10.3% as of mid-september. 
given a potentially adverse external environment, however, 
it is crucial to sustain domestic reform momentum. this 
entails both structural reforms to support growth capacity 
and macroeconomic efforts to rebuild fiscal and monetary 
buffers.
the mpc’s main contribution is to deliver low and stable 
inflation, with well-anchored inflation expectations.
we also recommend additional measures that would 
improve economic conditions. these include reaching a 
prudent public debt level, further repairing and strengthening 
network industries, lowering administered price inflation and 
keeping real wage growth in line with productivity gains.

notes
a. the nominal effective exchange rate (neer) is based on the bilateral exchange rates of south africa’s three largest trading partners (the eurozone, us and japan). the bilateral exchange rates are 
weighted by export trade weights. the implied starting point for the rand forecast is r18.04 to the us dollar.
b. the nominal exchange rate steady state is estimated using the purchasing power parity (ppp) condition, which links the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to the inflation differential 
between south africa and abroad. given that the real effective exchange rate (reer) depreciation is zero at steady state, the nominal exchange rate will therefore depreciate by 2.5% per year 
in steady state, reflecting the inflation (target) differential between domestic (4.5%) and foreign (2.0%) inflation.
c. the reer is the neer deflated by the consumer price differential between south africa and the trade-weighted cpi of the eurozone, us and japan.
d. the real exchange rate gap signifies the extent to which the real exchange rate deviates from its estimated equilibrium level. a positive gap shows an overvaluation of the currency and vice versa.
e. the unit labour cost (ulc) is the labour cost to produce one ‘unit’ of output. this is calculated as the total wages and salaries in the non-agricultural sector divided by the real value added at basic 
prices in the non-agricultural sector of the economy.
f. the repo rate at the end of the period refers to the average for the last quarter of the year. the nominal repo rate steady state is calculated as the sum of south africa’s inflation target (4.5%) 
and the steady-state neutral real interest rate (nrir) (2.5%).
g. the nrir is the policy rate minus inflation, which prevails when the economy is fully in balance, with inflation at target and output at potential. the policy stance 
is measured as either tight or loose based on whether actual rates are above or below this neutral rate respectively. the steady-state nrir is calculated as the sum of the respective steady 
states for the group of three (g3) nrir (0.5%), south africa’s risk premium (2.0%) and the change in the reer (0.0%). before the steady state is reached, it is possible for the reer equilibrium to 
appreciate or depreciate, so this value can have a non-zero value over the medium term. it is nonetheless always zero in the long run.
h. the steady state is the long-run value in the model. while model equilibriums can have different values over the medium term, as conditions change, all equilibriums eventually reach a steady 
state, where they stabilise.
i. the forecast of the current account balance is obtained from the sarb’s core macroeconometric model.
j. shaded areas indicate the forecasts of the monetary policy committee (mpc).
k. the figures in brackets represent the previous forecasts of the mpc.

foreign sector assumptions
1. trading-partner gross domestic product (gdp) 
g r o w t h is broadly determined using the global projection 
model (gpm), which is adjusted to aggregate the gdp 
growth rates of south africa’s major trading partners 
on a trade-weighted basis. individual projections are 
done for the six largest trading partners, namely the 
eurozone, united states (us), united kingdom (uk), 
japan, china and india. other countries considered, 
although with small weights, are brazil, mexico and 
russia. the remaining trading partners are grouped 
into the ‘rest of countries’ bloc. since sub-saharan 
africa is also a major trading region for south africa 
(but does not have a bloc in the gpm), it is modelled 
separately and then combined with the aggregate of 
all the countries in the gpm to make up total trading-
partner growth.
2. as with gdp growth, the output gap is determined using 
the gpm and is adjusted in a similar way. the output gap 
is driven by a combination of country-specific domestic 
factors, external factors and financial-real linkages 
(beyond interest rate and exchange rate effects). 
domestic factors include expectations of future demand 
and medium-term interest rates. external factors include 
exchange rate impacts on demand, direct spillovers 
through trade with trading-partner countries and 
foreign demand.
3. the commodity price index is a weighted aggregate price 
index of the major south african export commodities.
4. the brent crude oil price is expressed in us dollars 
per barrel. the assumption incorporates supply and 
demand dynamics as well as oil inventories (of all grades). 
the assumption is also informed by projections from the 
us energy information administration, the organization 
of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) 
and reuters.
5. world food prices is the composite food price index 
of the food and agriculture organization (fao) of the 
united nations (un) in us dollars. it is weighted using 
average export shares and represents the monthly 
change in the international prices of a basket of five 
food commodity price indices (cereals, vegetable oil, 
dairy, meat and sugar). world food price prospects 
incorporate selected global institution forecasts for 
food prices and imbalances from the anticipated trend 
in international food supplies relative to expected food 
demand pressures.
6. international consumer prices are also broadly 
determined using the gpm. the index is an aggregate 
of the consumer price indices of the eurozone, us 
and japan, weighted by their relative trade shares. 
consumer prices are determined for each of these 
economies by accounting for inflation expectations, 
demand pressures and pass-through from changes in 
the relevant exchange rate. other institutional forecasts 
for international consumer prices are also considered.
7. international policy interest rates are again broadly 
determined using the gpm. interest rates are a weighted 
average of the policy rates of the eurozone, us and 
japan. they are individually determined by a ‘taylor-
type’ monetary policy rule. the communications of the 
relevant central banks and other institutional forecasts 
are also considered.

domestic sector assumptions
1. the electricity price is an administered price measured 
at the municipal level with a weight of 3.63% in the 
headline consumer price index (cpi) basket. electricity 
price adjustments generally take place in the months of 
july and august of each year, and the assumed pace of 
increase over the forecast period reflects the multi-year 
price determination agreement between eskom and the 
national energy regulator of south africa (nersa), with a 
slight adjustment for measurement at the municipal level.
2. fuel taxes and levies are the total domestic taxes and 
costs included in the price of fuel paid at the pump. they 
include the road accident fund (raf) levy, the fuel levy, 
retail and wholesale margins, the slate levy and other 
minor levies. the two major taxes, which are set by the 
minister of finance in the annual national budget, are 
the raf levy and the fuel levy. the income generated by 
the raf levy is utilised to compensate third-party victims 
of motor vehicle accidents, while the fuel levy is used to 
provide funding for road infrastructure.
3. potential growth is derived from the south african 
reserve bank’s (sarb) semi-structural potential output 
model. the measurement accounts for the impact of the 
financial cycle on real economic activity and introduces 
economic structure via the relationship between potential 
output and capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector 
(sarb working paper series no. wp/18/02).
4. the midpoint of the inflation target range is 4.5%. 
the official inflation target range is 3–6%.
5. the neutral real interest rate (nrir) is the interest rate 
consistent with stable inflation and output in line with 
the economy’s potential. this variable is the basis for 
judging whether a given policy stance is expansionary, 
contractionary or neutral. 
6. in projecting load-shedding costs, the forecast considers 
the intensity and timing of load-shedding (whether it is a 
higher or lower stage, and whether it occurs during office 
hours or not). higher stages of load-shedding, during 
office hours, are more costly.

glossary
advanced economies: advanced economies are countries 
with high gross domestic product (gdp) per capita, 
diversified exports and close integration into the global 
financial system. 
balance of payments : this is a record of transactions 
between the home country and the rest of the world over a 
specific period of time. it includes the current and financial 
accounts. see also ‘current account’ below.
brent crude: brent crude is a light and sweet blend of oil from 
five different fields in the north sea. the price of brent crude 
is one of the benchmark oil prices in international markets.
budget deficit: a budget deficit indicates the extent to which 
government expenditure exceeds government revenue.
business and consumer confidence : these are economic 
indicators that measure the level of optimism about 
the economy and its prospects among business managers 
and consumers.
commodities: commodities can refer to energy, agriculture, 
metals and minerals. major south african-produced 
commodities include platinum and gold.
consumer price index (cpi): the cpi provides an indication 
of aggregate price changes in the domestic economy. 
the index is calculated using a number of categories 
forming a representative set of goods and services bought 
by consumers.
core inflation : core generally refers to underlying 
inflation, excluding the volatile elements (e.g. food 
and energy prices). the sarb’s forecasts and 
discussions refer to headline cpi excluding food, 
non-alcoholic beverages (nab), fuel and electricity prices.
crude oil price : this is the united states (us) dollar price 
per barrel of unrefined oil. see also ‘brent crude’ above.
current account : the current account of the balance of 
payments consists of net exports (exports less imports) 
in the trade account as well as the services, income and 
current transfers.
emerging markets : emerging markets are countries with 
low to middle income per capita. they are advancing 
rapidly and are integrating with global (product and 
capital) markets.
exchange rate depreciation (appreciation) : exchange rate 
depreciation (appreciation) refers to a decrease (increase) in 
the value of a currency relative to another currency.
exchange rate pass-through: this is the effect of exchange 
rate changes on domestic inflation (i.e. the percentage 
change in domestic cpi due to a change in the exchange 
rate). changes in the exchange rate affect import prices, 
which in turn affect domestic consumer prices and inflation.
forecast horizon : this is the future period over which the 
sarb generates its forecasts, typically between two and 
three years.
gross domestic product (gdp) : gdp is the total market 
value of all the goods and services produced in a country. it 
includes total consumption expenditure, capital formation, 
government consumption expenditure and the value of 
exports less the value of imports.
gross fixed capital formation (investment) : the value of 
acquisitions of capital goods (e.g. machinery, equipment 
and buildings) by firms, adjusted for disposals, constitutes 
gross fixed capital formation.
headline consumer price index (cpi) : headline cpi refers 
to cpi for all urban areas, as measured on a monthly basis 
by statistics south africa (stats sa). headline cpi is a 
measure of price levels in all urban areas. the 12-month 
percentage change in headline cpi is referred to as ‘headline 
cpi inflation’ and reflects changes in the cost of living. this 
is the official inflation measure for south africa.
household consumption : this is the amount of money 
spent by households on consumer goods and services.
inflation (growth) outlook: this outlook refers to the evolution 
of future inflation (growth) over the forecast horizon.
inflation targeting : this is a monetary policy framework 
used by central banks to steer actual inflation towards an 
inflation target level or range.
the monetary base (m0): m0 comprises total banknotes 
and coin in issue and in circulation outside of the south 
african reserve bank (sarb), net of issuance and removal 
from circulation, plus banks’ required cash reserves as well 
as their excess cash reserves and other deposits at the 
sarb in rand
monetary policy normalisation: this refers to the unwinding 
of an unusually accommodative monetary policy. it could 
also mean adjusting the economy’s policy rate towards its 
real neutral policy rate.
neutral real interest rate (nrir) : the nrir is the level at 
which the real interest rate will settle once the output gap is 
closed and inflation is stable. 
nominal effective exchange rate (neer) : the neer 
is an index that expresses the value of a country’s 
currency relative to a basket of other (trading-partner) 
currencies. an increase (decrease) in the neer indicates 
a strengthening (weakening) of the domestic currency with 
respect to the selected basket of currencies. the weighted 
average exchange rate of the rand is calculated against 
20 currencies. the weights of the five major currencies 
are as follows: the euro ( 30.68%), chinese yuan (24.53%), 
us dollar (10.56%), japanese yen (4.95%) and indian 
rupee (4.85%). index: 2015 = 100. see also ‘real effective 
exchange rate’ below.

output gap/potential growth : potential growth is the rate 
of gdp growth that could theoretically be achieved if all the 
productive assets in the economy were employed in a stable 
inflation environment. the output gap is the difference between 
actual growth and potential growth, which accumulates over 
time. if this is negative, then the economy is viewed to be 
underperforming and demand pressures on inflation are low. 
if the output gap is positive, the economy is viewed to be 
overheating and demand pressures are inflationary.
policy rate: a policy rate is the interest rate used by a central 
bank to implement monetary policy.
productivity: productivity indicates the amount of goods and 
services produced in relation to the resources utilised in the 
form of labour and capital.
real effective exchange rate (reer) : the reer is the neer 
adjusted for inflation differentials between south africa and its 
main trading partners. see also ‘nominal effective exchange 
rate’ above.
repurchase (repo) rate : this is the policy rate that is set 
by the monetary policy committee (mpc). it is the rate that 
commercial banks pay to borrow money from the sarb.
real repo rate : this is the nominal repo rate, as set by the 
mpc, adjusted for expected inflation.
terms of trade : this refers to the ratio of export prices to 
import prices.
unit labour cost (ulc) : a ulc is the labour cost to produce 
one ‘unit’ of output. this is calculated as the total wages 
and salaries in the non-agricultural sector divided by the real 
value added at basic prices in the non-agricultural sector of 
the economy.
