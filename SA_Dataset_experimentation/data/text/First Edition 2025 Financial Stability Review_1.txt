Background to the Financial 
Stability Review
The primary mandate of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), as stated in the 
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, is to achieve and maintain price stability 
in the interest of balanced and sustainable economic growth in South Africa. The 
Financial Sector Regulation Act 9 of 2017 (FSR Act) assigns a statutory mandate to 
the SARB to protect and enhance financial stability in South Africa.  
The SARB follows a structured framework designed to gather information and monitor 
developments, assess financial stability, and communicate its assessment through 
the Financial Stability Review (FSR) . Among other things, the FSR Act requires the 
SARB to (i) monitor and review any risks to financial stability, including the nature 
and extent of those risks as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the financial 
system; and (ii) take steps to mitigate risks to financial stability, including advising 
the financial sector regulators and any other organ of state of the steps that should 
be taken to mitigate those risks.
The FSR Act also requires the SARB to assess the stability of the South African financial 
system at least every six months and to communicate its assessment in the FSR , 
which is tabled in Parliament. The FSR provides readers with the SARB’s assessment 
of the stability of the South African financial system. The SARB assesses financial 
stability as part of its ongoing operations, and its Financial Stability Committee (FSC) 
reviews the financial stability outlook and assessment at six meetings per year. The 
period under review for this edition of the FSR is the six months from December 2024 
to May 2025, while the forecast period is until June 2026.
The FSR aims to inform members of Parliament, participants in the financial sector, 
international central bank peers, ratings agencies, international financial institutions, 
standard-setting bodies and academia of financial stability-related developments 
and the commensurate policy actions taken by the relevant authorities to protect 
and enhance financial stability. The FSR further aims to stimulate debate on pertinent 
issues related to financial stability in South Africa.

Executive summary
In the November 2024 Financial Stability Review (FSR) , the South African Reserve 
Bank (SARB) noted the resilience of the South African financial system despite 
various global and domestic shocks. The SARB also judged that the financial stability 
outlook had improved over the course of 2024. The assessment was supported by 
factors such as reduced electricity shortages, evidence of fiscal consolidation and 
an improved sovereign credit rating outlook, all of which bolstered sentiment. The 
orderly national elections and the subsequent formation of a Government of National 
Unity (GNU) further supported the improved financial stability outlook.
Conditions in 2025 have been more challenging. Globally, systemic risk increased 
during the period under review, mainly due to a surge in policy uncertainty in 
response to international trade conflicts. Other factors such as fears over a United 
States (US) recession, downward revisions to global growth projections, and new and 
ongoing military conflicts have added to the sense of a global poly-crisis. In turn, this 
has contributed to extreme market volatility globally and significant losses in some 
asset classes. 
These global uncertainties and the implications for domestic financial stability are the 
focus of this edition of the FSR . The key risks to fi nancial stability discussed in this 
edition are as follows: 
i. increased geopolitical tension and policy uncertainty;  
ii. rapid capital outflows amid heightened market uncertainty;
iii. critical domestic infrastructure failure; 
iv.  remaining on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) greylist over the medium 
term;
v. deteriorating public sector debt ratios; and  
vi.  increased financial distress in households and small- and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs).
Despite falling outside of the six-month review period to the end of May 2025, a 
noteworthy development was the statement released by the FATF on 13 June 2025. 
The statement confirmed that South Africa had addressed or largely addressed all 
22 action items agreed to as per the Action Plan following South Africa’s greylisting 
in February 2023. The risk of South Africa remaining on the FATF greylist over the 
medium term has therefore reduced significantly. The South African financial system 
continued to function without interruption and despite heightened market volatility. 
Prudentially regulated domestic financial institutions remained resilient, partly owing 
to their ability to maintain adequate capital buffers to absorb the impact of shocks. 
However, downwards revisions to the domestic economic growth forecast will likely 
test this resilience beyond the forecast period. 
This edition of the FSR  also includes the SARB’s revised credit-to-gross domestic 
product (GDP) gap and a summary of the results from the 2024-2025 Climate Risk 
Stress Test (CRST).

Financial stability 
developments and outlook
Global developments and risks
Geopolitical conflicts have contributed to market volatility, and higher trade and 
economic policy uncertainty since the beginning of 2025 (Figure 1).  Escalating 
trade tensions have further fuelled concerns over a slowing in, or even reversal of, 
globalisation. As a result, the global economy faces a potential sharp retrenchment of 
trade, and possibly a reversal of the benefits yielded by decades of global economic 
and financial integration. Financial stability could be impaired through channels 
including lower global growth, higher inflation and interest rates, increased risk 
aversion, and heightened liquidity and solvency stress for financial institutions.

Geopolitical risks have broad implications for global economic stability.  Geo-
economic fragmentation could limit market access, not only increasing the cost 
but also reducing the availability of funding, hedging and diversification options. 
Additionally, fragmentation could hamper international cooperation on critical issues 
such as climate change, financial regulation and public health.
Since the release of the November 2024 FSR , the gold price has risen sharply, 
reflecting growing market uncertainty and heightened volatility (Figure 2). The 
price of gold increased from around US $2 600 per ounce at the start of 2025 to 
US$3 300 per ounce at the end of May, reaching its highest price ever of US$3 432 
per ounce on 13 June 2025. This increase corresponds with significant increases in a 
range of market volatility indices since the start of the year.

In its latest Global Financial Stability Report , the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) identifies three key emerging vulnerabilities. 1 These are (i) stretched asset 
valuations in certain key global markets; (ii) highly leveraged financial institutions 
exacerbating the sovereign-financial sector nexus; and (iii) market volatility and 
uncertainty exacerbating debt vulnerabilities for heavily indebted sovereigns. 
In contrast to various other economies, asset valuations in South Africa do 
not appear stretched currently. South Africa is, however, vulnerable to a sharp 
repricing in government debt, especially in the context of risk-off swings in global 
financial markets.
Domestic developments and key risks to financial 
stability
The SARB uses a wide range of financial stability indicators that are designed 
to act as early-warning signals of a potential build-up of cyclical changes in the 
financial system that could lead to vulnerabilities if left unattended. 2 A ‘snapshot’ 
of all material developments is communicated through the financial stability heatmap 
(Figure 3). The heatmap visually depicts the statistical transformation of a wide 
range of financial stability indicators against their historical averages. It is data driven 
and based on historical information, and does not contain any evaluation of financial 
stability risks. It serves as a communication tool to flag areas for deeper analyses. 3

stability-report-april-2025.
2  Both Adrian et al. (2015) and Aikman et al. (2017) note that a shortcoming of the framework underpinning 
the monitoring of financial stability vulnerabilities and the construction of financial stability heatmaps 
is its focus on cyclical vulnerabilities and not structural and event vulnerabilities.
3  Refer to Annexure A for an overview of how the South African financial stability heatmap is composed, 
including the indicators underlying the various heatmap elements. In an effort to continually improve 
the reliability of the indicators used in the heatmap and to keep them relevant, they are reviewed and 
updated from time to time.

The heatmap is based on a z-score transformation of the underlying indicators. 
The transformed indicators are thereafter mapped onto an empirical cumulative 
distribution function (ECDF). Low values from the ECDF are mapped to green while 
higher values are mapped to shades of red.

Not every indicator used in the construction of the heatmap is discussed in the 
FSR. Rather, the focus is on key global and domestic factors that may be relevant 
to financial stability risks and vulnerabilities in South Africa. The potential build-up 
of imbalances as reflected in the heatmap is discussed in detail in the write-up of 
the key risks and vulnerabilities identified as per the SARB Residual Vulnerability 
Matrix (RVM).

The SARB’s financial stability heatmap highlights the build-up of financial 
imbalances across several macroprudential indicators. The most notable of these 
relate to banks’ sovereign exposure, government debt and interest payments, net 
portfolio purchases by non-residents and financial strain in households. Indicators 
demonstrating resilience in the financial sector include aggregate capital and liquidity 
buffers exceeding the minimum regulatory requirements.
Following the national elections in May 2024, the formation of the GNU was a 
catalyst for a significant rally in South African assets. The South African equity 
market responded very positively, but South African equities were coming off a low 
base after a long period of underperformance compared to global equities. The re-
rating of South African equities pushed the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in 
June 2024 to a 3-year high before reverting closer to the 10-year average. This was 
largely due to the increased global market volatility and uncertainty observed since 
the beginning of 2025. Exposure to elevated precious metals prices has partially 
driven local equities’ recent performance, but the underwhelming domestic economic 
growth outlook will likely keep valuations constrained over the short to medium term.
Compared to emerging-market peers, domestic banks’ holdings of total 
government debt are relatively low (Figure 4). 4  By contrast, local sovereign debt 
holdings among domestic non-bank financial institutions are high relative to South 
Africa’s peers (Figure 5). The SARB will continue to monitor the broader sovereign-
financial sector nexus given the importance of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) 
in the domestic financial system, and the high level of interconnectedness between 
banks and non-banks. 5

4  While South African banks’ overall holdings of total government debt are low, non-systemic banks’ 
holdings are high compared to South Africa’s EM peers. However, non-systemic banks account for less 
than 5% of South African banking sector assets. See Box 1 on page 12 of the November 2023 FSR for 
a discussion on the differences between systemic and non-systemic banks’ holdings of government 
debt (https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home/publications/review/financial-stability-review ).

In the first five months of 2025, non-residents sold R111 billion of South African 
equities, consistent with a broad-based retreat from emerging-market equities 
amid heightened risk aversion. While non-residents increased their nominal holdings 
of domestic bonds by R27.2 billion between December 2024 and May 2025, the share 
of foreign holdings of South African government bonds declined marginally from 
24.6% to 24.5% during this period.
The SARB’s Financial Conditions Index (FCI) 6 shows that domestic financial 
conditions continue to be relatively tight (Figure 6). Equity-market volatility has 
remained elevated since the release of the November 2024 FSR . Declines in credit 
extended to households, and higher long-term government bond yields, were the 
other main contributors to tighter financial conditions.

This edition of the FSR  includes the SARB’s revised credit-to-GDP gap. 7 When 
credit grows too quickly relative to real economic activity, it can create systemic 
risks in the financial sector. Financial institutions tend to lend excessively during 
economic booms and then restrict lending during downturns, which can worsen 
economic recessions. To address this, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS) suggests using the credit-to-GDP gap as a tool to identify rising credit risk 
that can lead to systemic instability. When this gap exceeds certain thresholds, 
macroprudential policy instruments such as the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) 
can be used to build resilience in the financial system against potential downturns. 
7  The credit-to-GDP gap is simply the cyclical component of the credit-to-GDP ratio and is obtained 
by subtracting the long-term trend component of this ratio from its actual value. The full paper, 
titled The South African credit gap as real-time early warning indicator of financial imbalances , is 
available at https://www.resbank.co.za/content/dam/sarb/what-we-do/financial-stability/TB-05%20

The credit-to-GDP gap is one of several indicators the SARB employs to monitor 
financial stability conditions. 8 A positive credit-to-GDP gap indicates that total 
credit extension relative to the size of the economy is above its long-term trend, 
while a negative gap suggests that credit growth is below its long-term trend.  
Figure 7 shows that South Africa’s credit-to-GDP gap has been negative since the 
fourth quarter of 2020, implying that there has not been excessive credit extension 
over this period and is therefore not considered a vulnerability from a financial 
stability perspective.

Quantitative indicators such as the heatmap, FCI and credit-to-GDP gap are useful 
for assessing cyclical risks that typically build up over long periods. However, 
there are also structural risks to financial stability that are not necessarily evident in 
quantitative indicators. The SARB’s RVM contains a combination of the  key cyclical 
and structural risks facing the domestic financial system. This edition of the FSR  
identifies the following key risks to domestic financial stability:
i. increased geopolitical tension and policy uncertainty;  
ii. rapid capital outflows amid heightened market uncertainty;
iii. critical domestic infrastructure failure; 
iv. remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term;
v. deteriorating public sector debt ratios; and  
vi. increased financial distress in households and SMEs.
8  Other indicators include the SARB’s financial stability heatmap (Figure 3), FCI, results from stress-
testing exercises, research outputs, systemic risk analyses and interconnectedness measures. For more 
information, refer to the SARB’s macroprudential policy framework and decision-making process,  and 
its financial stability monitoring and assessment framework (available at https://www.resbank.co.za/
en/home/what-we-do/financial-stability).

These risks are reflected on the SARB’s RVM (Figure 8). The RVM reflects the 
SARB’s assessment of the residual vulnerability (i.e. the remaining vulnerability after 
accounting for mitigating factors and actions) of the South African financial system 
to the identified risks. Residual vulnerability takes into account both the probability of 
a risk materialising within the forecast period (i.e. the next 12 months), and the effect 
of mitigating (or amplifying) factors that reduce (or increase) the financial system’s 
vulnerability to these risks. The closer to the outer edge of the circle, the higher the 
residual vulnerability and vice versa.

Besides the temporal risks included in the RVM, the financial sector continues to 
operate in an environment with perpetual risks. The key perpetual risks are the impact 
of climate change on the financial sector, the threat of a cyber-incident with systemic 
impact, and persistently low and inequitable domestic economic growth. Each of 
these key risks is discussed in subsequent sections. Crucial to note is the possibility 
of these risks interacting, which could greatly amplify the impact of a shock.
Financial stability summary and assessment 
Since the November 2024 FSR , the South African financial system’s vulnerability 
has increased to the risks of (i) increased geopolitical tension and global policy 
uncertainty; (ii) rapid capital outflows amid heightened market uncertainty; and (iii) 
critical domestic infrastructure failure. By contrast, residual vulnerability decreased 
significantly against the risk of remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term. 
Residual vulnerability against the risks of deteriorating public sector debt ratios, and 
increased financial distress in households and SMEs remains unchanged since the 
November 2024 FSR. 
June 2025FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW

The SARB’s assessment of the stability of the South African financial system 
during the period under review is that the domestic financial system continued to 
be resilient. This resilience is expected to be sustained over the forecast period to 
June 2026. The key risks to domestic financial stability and the residual vulnerability 
of the South African financial system to these risks are discussed next. 
Increased geopolitical tension and policy uncertainty
South Africa is vulnerable to spillover effects from global policy uncertainty 
and geopolitical tensions. Global and domestic policy uncertainty is increased by 
trade-related tensions and physical conflicts. This contributes to heightened financial 
market volatility, which leads investors to divest from riskier assets. 
On 2 April 2025 – so-called ‘Liberation Day’ – the US announced trade tariffs 
against more than 180 countries. Among other things, this led to large-scale sell-
offs in global equity markets, heightening concerns over the impact on US gross 
domestic product (GDP) and the increased likelihood of a US recession. Domestically, 
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) closed 3.4% lower on 3 April 2025 and 5.3% 
lower the following day, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the unexpected and 
unprecedented scale of the US tariffs.
The US has several tools at its disposal to promote international alignment with 
its own economic and political interests. Potential actions range from reducing or 
stopping foreign assistance to imposing trade tariffs on goods exported to the US. 
In the most extreme cases, sanctions could be imposed. Such actions would again 
range widely in terms of focus and severity, likely starting with targeting individuals 
as per the US Global Magnitsky Act, 9 rather than broad-based measures.
In the case of South Africa, the likely non-renewal of the US African Growth 
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the imposition of tariffs on US-South Africa 
trade could increase vulnerability in the domestic financial system. The SARB’s 
April 2025 Monetary Policy Review (MPR)  modelled the impact of tariffs on US-
South Africa trade according to three scenarios. 10 Under the first scenario, AGOA is 
terminated without any tariffs imposed on South African goods exported to the US, 
leading to a marginal reduction of 0.04% in GDP. In the second scenario, AGOA is 
terminated alongside the imposition of a 25% tariff on South African exports, causing 
a slightly larger decline in GDP by 0.23%. The third scenario assumes the termination 
of AGOA, a 25% tariff on exports and a 15% depreciation in the rand caused by risk 
premium spillovers. The projected impact is the most severe for the third scenario, 
decreasing GDP by 0.69%. 
9  The Global Magnitsky Sanctions aim to combat corruption and human rights abuses by imposing asset 
freezes, travel restrictions, and restrictions on conducting business with US citizens and entities on 
targeted individuals and entities. The effectiveness of restrictions emanates from the global influence 
of the US financial system, which requires banks and other organisations globally to enforce the 
restrictions or risk being subjected to secondary sanctions (for more information, see https://www.
sanctions.io/blog/global-magnitsky-sanctions ).

June 2025FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW

The SARB will continue to monitor the potential financial stability impact of 
the 30% tariffs imposed on selected South African exports to the US on 2 April 
2025. The likely implications that a decline in GDP could have for financial stability 
would be by amplifying the vulnerability of the financial system to the existing risks 
of deteriorating public sector debt ratios, critical domestic infrastructure failure and 
increased financial distress in households and SMEs.
The vulnerability of the South African financial system to the risk of increased 
geopolitical tension and global policy uncertainty has increased since the 
November 2024 FSR. The increase is largely attributable to the observed significant 
impact of spillover effects to South Africa from global developments, and the limited 
extent to which South Africa can mitigate them.

Tighter global financial conditions, increased risk aversion and heightened 
macroeconomic uncertainty may lead to capital outflows. There are several 
channels through which capital outflows can impact the ability of South African 
firms – financial and non-financial – to obtain affordable funding. Capital outflows 
can put pressure on the exchange rate and inflation, or cause increased exchange 
rate volatility. A material sell-off in rand-denominated government bonds may raise 
government borrowing costs and undermine fiscal sustainability. Reduced foreign 
participation in local bond markets can lead to funding stress, increasing reliance on 
domestic financing sources and tightening overall liquidity conditions. 
Non-resident investment is an important mitigating factor to supplement a 
savings rate that is insufficient to support sustainable economic growth. With a 
negative net national savings rate12 of 0.5% of GDP as at the end of 2024, the majority 
of South African savings is absorbed by government borrowing.  
Procyclical investor behaviour during periods of market stress exacerbates sell-
offs and market volatility. However, South Africa’s flexible exchange rate regime and 
credible inflation-targeting framework act as mitigants against foreign outflows. The 
stable domestic investor base further acts as a buffer through the demand for bonds 
in the event of a sell-off by foreign investors. 
The entrenchment of the US dollar in the South African financial system could 
present a vulnerability in the form of concentration risk. Box 1 considers the extent 
to which the US dollar is entrenched within the South African financial system.
11  This risk has been discussed extensively in recent editions of the FSR . See Box 2 in the May 2022 FSR  
(https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home/publications/review/financial-stability-review ).
12  The net savings rate is calculated as gross national savings less consumption of fixed capital or 
depreciation.

The US dollar accounts for 96% of all South African foreign-currency (FX) transactions 
and 98% of its foreign currency debt (Figure B1.1), while 53% of its gross reserves (Figure

Since the November 2024 FSR , the South African financial system’s vulnerability 
to the risk of rapid capital outflows has increased amid heightened market 
uncertainty. This increase is largely due to the exogenous nature of the risk and the 
limited risk mitigation impact of domestic macroprudential policies. 
Critical domestic infrastructure failure 
The deterioration in critical national infrastructure such as roads, railways, water 
and electricity has contributed to South Africa’s structural challenge of low and 
inequitable economic growth. Critical infrastructure failure can affect financial 
stability through various channels. Among these is the credit channel, where either 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) themselves or industries highly dependent on them 
become unable to service and repay debt. This could in turn contribute to a further 
deterioration in the fiscal position if bail-outs are required. Critical infrastructure 
failure also increases financial institutions’ operational costs by requiring increasing 
levels of back-up services and contingency plans. 
Rail tonnages decreased consistently between 2017 and 2022, with total Transnet 
rail volumes decreasing from 226 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes over this 
period (Figure 9). The government roadmap for allowing private train operator 
companies to access the national rail network should support the growth targets in 
2025 and 2026.
The US dollar consistently accounts for 93%–97% of South Africa’s turnover in the South 
African FX market (Figure B1.3). By comparison, turnover in the next-largest currency – 
the euro – ranges between 2.2% and 3.9% of total FX turnover.

A promising mitigant to the risk of critical infrastructure failure is phase 2 of 
Operation Vulindlela – a reform initiative housed in the Presidency and National 
Treasury. Its focus areas include reform of the local government system, the water 
sector and the transport sector, with emphasis on the freight logistics system. A 
review of the municipal funding model was formally launched in April 2025. 
Although the financial system remains vulnerable to electricity supply-related 
fragilities, resilience has increased largely due to sustained growth in renewable 
energy generation registered and installed (Figure 10). This has alleviated pressure 
on the electricity grid, leading to a notable reduction in load-shedding since April 
2024 (Figure 11), despite the reintroduction of moderate levels of load-shedding in 
the first few months of 2025.

Playbooks have been developed to respond to any operational disruption that 
may prevent the financial system from providing financial products and services 
uninterruptedly. 13 From an operational resilience perspective, the Financial Sector 
Contingency Forum (FSCF) 14 has developed frameworks for responding to shocks 
such as a loss of access to national and international financial and technological 
infrastructure. Operational disruptions such as the CrowdStrike incident in July 2024 
or the failure of undersea data cables in March 2024 could also result in reduced, or 
even a complete loss of, access to critical international financial and technological 
infrastructure.
South Africa depends on nine undersea cables to connect it to the rest of the 
world. Four of these were damaged during the March 2024 incident, presenting a 
notable vulnerability to the domestic financial system. While not aimed at responding 
to any disruption in connectivity in particular, the FSCF’s Alternative Connectivity 
Project mitigates some of the domestic financial system’s vulnerability in this regard.15  
The risk of critical domestic infrastructure failure has increased slightly since the 
November 2024 FSR . Despite the improved longer-term electricity-supply outlook 
and better rail and port infrastructure performance, the weak financial position 
of numerous municipalities and sustained pressure on the fiscus will curtail the 
investment required to maintain and expand critical domestic infrastructure.
Remaining on the FATF greylist over the medium term
Following the recent FATF Plenary meetings held on 12 and 13 June 2025 in 
Strasbourg, France, the FATF announced that South Africa had addressed or 
largely addressed all 22 action items agreed to as per the Action Plan following 
South Africa’s greylisting in February 2023. 16 As a result, the FATF confirmed that 
an on-site assessment would be conducted to verify that reforms to combat money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism had been implemented and were being 
sustained, and that the necessary political commitment remained in place.
Following the announcement by the FATF, National Treasury released a media 
statement, noting that the FATF Africa Joint Group would conduct the on-site 
visit.17 The on-site visit will take place before the next FATF Plenary in October 2025. 
Should the outcome of the on-site visit confirm that satisfactory progress had been 
made, the FATF is expected to delist South Africa from the greylist at its October 
2025 Plenary meeting. 
The announcement by the FATF means that the risk of South Africa remaining on 
the greylist has decreased significantly since the November 2024 FSR . Should 
South Africa be delisted from the FATF greylist at the FATF’s Plenary meeting in 
October 2025, this risk will be removed from the RVM.

Deteriorating public sector debt ratios
South Africa recorded consecutive primary surpluses in the 2023/24 and 
2024/25 fiscal years. Before that, the last primary surplus was recorded in the 
2008/09 fiscal year. Improved market sentiment in the second half of 2024 also 
compressed sovereign yields, moderating the rise in debt-service costs.
Despite the improved outlook for the primary balance, there are various 
remaining risks to the fiscal outlook. Fiscal revenues are vulnerable to domestic 
and global shocks, which has historically translated to an underperformance in the 
primary balance and increasing sovereign debt. The projected 2025/26 borrowing 
requirement remains high relative to the 2008/09–2018/19 average, which makes 
South Africa’s fiscal outcomes particularly vulnerable to shocks (Figure 12).

The precarious financial positions of numerous SOEs and municipalities pose 
a risk for further deterioration in the fiscal position. This may materialise in the 
form of potential bailouts – as has been the trend since 2017 – or the realisation 
of contingent liabilities. Fiscal revenue shortfalls can lead to immediate budgetary 
constraints at national, provincial, municipal and SOE-specific levels, in turn curtailing 
the provision of critical infrastructure and services.
As mentioned in several previous editions of the FSR , the financial sector has 
significant sovereign exposures. Financial institutions hold high levels of government 
bonds in their portfolios, making them vulnerable to repricing risk, should the 
fiscal position weaken further, in particular if holdings are unhedged and not marked 
to market.18 
Analyses by the Prudential Authority (PA) confirmed that the six domestic 
systemically important banks use effective hedging strategies and that adequate 
capital buffers are available for the valuation gap of government instruments 
held at amortised cost. As at 31 October 2024, systemically important banks’ 
gross on-balance sheet exposure to sovereign instruments held at amortised cost 
amounted to R579.2 billion, with a fair value of R577.5 billion. The valuation gain of the 
hedges deployed to mitigate against the unrealised losses of R1.6 billion amounted to 
R5 billion, resulting in a post-hedge profit of R3.4 billion should the need have arisen 
to liquidate the positions. Given the prudent provisioning by banks for their sovereign 
exposures, the risks to financial stability appear contained. However, the SARB and 
the PA will continue to monitor developments that could change this assessment.
18  Valuation gaps could arise due to different accounting treatments by financial institutions of their 
holdings of government bonds, either by accounting for holdings at current market prices (i.e. at prices 
marked to the current market value), or by accounting for holdings that are intended to be held until 
maturity (i.e. at the price the bonds would have if they were held until they matured). Even if financial 
institutions intend to hold government bonds until maturity, a change in circumstances may force them 
to sell before maturity. If the prevailing market price is significantly lower than the value they accounted 
for had the instruments been held to maturity, this could cause significant liquidity challenges. For a 
more detailed discussion of this risk, see page 40 of the May 2023 FSR  (https://www.resbank.co.za/
en/home/publications/review/financial-stability-review ).

High levels of public debt add another layer of vulnerability resulting from 
heightened geopolitical tension and policy uncertainty. Government’s limited 
fiscal space restricts its ability to respond effectively to external shocks.  
The South African financial system’s vulnerability to the risk of deteriorating 
public sector debt ratios has remained unchanged since the November 2024 FSR . 
Expectations that South Africa’s debt-to-GDP ratio will reach its peak in the 2025/26 
fiscal year and the prudent provisioning by banks for their sovereign exposures 
support this assessment.
Increased financial distress in households and SMEs 
Increased financial distress in households and SMEs is caused by factors such as 
high levels of debt, job losses or business disruptions. This can impact financial 
stability either directly (e.g. through loan defaults and delinquencies), or indirectly 
(e.g. by contributing to the systemic effects of already low growth and reliance on 
government support). 
An indicator of financial distress in households and SMEs is the number of non-
performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector. Rising NPLs typically prompt 
lenders to tighten lending standards, in turn reducing the supply of credit.19 NPLs have 
increased in the corporate and SME portfolios, but decreased in both the secured 
and unsecured retail portfolios since September 2024. However, the NPL ratios for all 
four of these asset classes remain above their long-term averages (Figure 14).
19  Refer to the credit-to-GDP gap (Figure 7 on page 7), which has been negative since the fourth quarter 
of 2020, implying that there has not been excessive credit extension over this period.

An important mitigating factor against default risk in the banking sector is the 
combination of sound credit risk management practices and the strict provisioning 
requirements applicable to banks. While this may not necessarily protect borrowers 
from becoming financially distressed, it serves as a buffer for banks by increasing their 
resilience to rising impairments, in turn supporting financial stability. The vulnerability 
of the South African financial system to the risk of increased financial distress in 
households and SMEs has remained unchanged since the November 2024 FSR .
Perpetual risks
Climate change 
The risks posed by climate change to financial stability remain broadly 
unchanged. This edition of the FSR  introduces the SARB’s overarching framework 
for assessing climate-related financial stability risks and vulnerabilities in the South 
African financial system. The framework (Figure 15) maps the process the SARB 
follows to gather relevant information and assess the residual vulnerability of the 
South African financial system to climate-related shocks, after accounting for existing 
mitigating measures. As was noted in the November 2024 FSR, these processes aim to 
June 2025FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW
20
align the financial stability monitoring and assessment framework with international 
best practice.
There is broad consensus in the literature that climate change poses two primary 
risks to the financial sector: physical and transition risks. Physical risks are mainly 
economic losses from more frequent and more intense weather events. Transition 
risks are increasingly driven by the lack of a co-ordinated global response to climate 
change and the inaction or inability of financial institutions to recognise and prepare 
for future risks and climate-related regulations. As countries transition at varying 
paces, the risk of a disorderly global shift to a low-carbon economy intensifies. 
A growing topic of focus internationally is the climate insurance protection gap. 
It refers to the uninsured portion of economic losses arising from climate-related 
shocks, and it is expected to widen as the risks associated with climate change 
increase. A related issue is the growing list of uninsurable risks (i.e. risks that insurance 
companies explicitly exclude from available insurance cover). The SARB is currently 
exploring methodologies to determine the climate insurance protection gap in South 
Africa. Further research is therefore critical. Wh ile preliminary research to assess the 
materiality of certain transition risks for the South African banking sector has been 
completed,20 more work is required to understand the transmission and amplification 
of both physical and transition risks. This would cover all financial institutions and 
certain non-financial sectors such as government, households and non-financial 
corporates.

This ongoing work forms part of the SARB’s broader financial stability research 
agenda, aimed at closing data and knowledge gaps, developing climate-specific 
micro- and macroprudential indicators, and enhancing the monitoring of climate-
related vulnerabilities. It will also support practical, evidence-based policymaking to 
improve the resilience of the South African financial sector to climate risks. 
A cyber-incident with systemic impact 
The cyber-environment is becoming increasingly complex due to the rapid 
development of new technologies, ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and 
widening skills gap in the cybersecurity industry. This complexity has broadened 
the gap between advanced and emerging economies, and has increased the 
disparities between different sectors in the economy. Increased geopolitical tensions 
further raise the likelihood of cyberattacks.
Cyberattacks on financial institutions have become so common that protecting 
against them is now routine. However, on a systemic level, the financial sector could 
fall victim to a situation where a single disruption could simultaneously impair multiple 
institutions, triggering a systemic event. 
South Africa’s cybersecurity spending remains below the mature market 
benchmark of 0.25% of GDP annually, which is a concern given the high cost 
of data breaches. South Africa’s data breach costs in 2024 amounted to US$2.78 
million, a slight decrease from US$2.79 million in 2023. Despite this small reduction, 
the average cost remains high. 21 Electricity-supply challenges in South Africa, 
although improving notably, add to cybersecurity vulnerabilities by exposing digital 
infrastructure to cyber-attacks. In addition, backup power systems often lack robust 
security protocols.  
As part of ongoing efforts to increase its resilience to cyber-risk, the SARB, in 
collaboration with CybExer and using the Bank for International Settlements’ 
(BIS) cyber-range infrastructure, hosted a cyber-range exercise from 11 to 14 
March 2025. Such exercises are invaluable for exposing cyber-professionals to real-
world cyber threats, but in a controlled environment. The exercise brought together 
45 participants from 19 financial institutions, organised into 6 multidisciplinary teams 
based on cybersecurity technical proficiency to ensure balanced team capability. 
The exercise tested participants across client-side, network and web application 
attack scenarios, simulating realistic and advanced threat vectors, including 
phishing, privilege escalation, supply chain compromise, data exfiltration and 
coordinated lateral movement across segmented networks. Participants were 
commended for their technical proficiency. Teams demonstrated strong situational 
awareness, effective internal coordination, and the utilisation of advanced monitoring 
tools to detect and respond to complex attacks. The exercise not only highlighted the 
resilience of South Africa’s financial sector to cyber-attacks, but also underscored 
the maturity of its cybersecurity practices in line with international standards.

Low and inequitable economic growth 
South Africa’s growth problem has not improved since the previous FSR . Real 
GDP growth has averaged only 0.54% on an annual basis since 2018, entrenching low 
private investment, higher levels of inequality and increasing levels of unemployment. 
The likely non-renewal of AGOA and the imposition of tariffs on US-South Africa 
trade would further exacerbate the challenge of low and inequitable economic 
growth. 
Policy actions and initiatives undertaken to enhance 
domestic financial stability 
•  Introducing a positive cycle-neutral (PCN) CCyB: First announced in the 
November 2023 FSR, the CCyB increased from 0% to 1% on 1 January 2025. Banks 
have until 31 December 2025 to implement the increase. A series of papers was 
published on 13 June 2025 with the methodology and results of the econometric 
models employed to model the impact of the 1% increase in the CCyB. 22
•  Mitigating the sovereign-financial sector nexus:  The PA is monitoring this 
risk through a bi-annual survey of banks’ valuation and hedging practices, and 
regularly reports to the FSC on these exposures to ensure that they are managed 
prudently.
•  Increasing the financial sector’s resilience to deal with systemic  operational 
disruptions: The SARB, through the FSCF, continued to plan for operational 
disruptions to the financial system with potential systemic impact, with notable 
progress made with the FSCF’s Alternative Connectivity Project. 23
•  Enhancing crisis preparedness and resolution planning: The SARB conducted 
two crisis simulation exercises in the first half of 2025. The first simulation was 
aimed at testing the processes of the SARB – as the Resolution Authority – and 
the Corporation for Deposit Insurance (CODI) in the event of a medium, non-
systemically important bank failure. The second simulation was an industry-wide 
desktop test of the agreed procedures for an orderly closure and reopening of 
markets, irrespective of the trigger event. 24
•  Enhancing cyber-resilience in the financial sector: The SARB, in collaboration 
with CybExer and using the BIS’s cyber-range infrastructure, hosted a cyber-range 
exercise from 11 to 14 March 2025. The exercise provided a valuable opportunity 
for cyber-professionals to respond to real-world cyber-threats, but in a controlled

Increasing operational resilience 
As discussed in the November 2024 FSR, increasing the operational resilience of the 
domestic financial system against the failure of critical national infrastructure remains 
a key financial stability priority. In pursuit of this objective, the SARB, together with 
the FSCF, announced in 2023 the development of various contingency plans to 
respond to a shock that could prevent the financial system from providing financial 
goods and services uninterruptedly. 
The initiative was initially motivated by the risk of an electricity grid collapse. The 
first phases of the project focused predominantly on how financial markets would 
be closed and reopened in an orderly manner. This led to the Orderly Closing and 
Reopening of the Markets (OCARM) initiative. Extensive work has been done to 
develop playbooks for the practical implementation of OCARM. 25 
In 2024, OCARM’s focus was broadened to ensure business continuity under different 
disruption scenarios. A current priority initiative is to establish direct, alternative 
connectivity among key nodes in the financial sector to enable continuity in a 
scenario where existing telecommunication networks are unable to function so that 
a certain level of payment, clearing and settlement activity can continue. This has 
been identified as an extreme but plausible scenario that will render financial systems 
unavailable, and prevent the financial system from providing services uninterruptedly. 
Other scenarios with related impact include a distributed cyber-attack on the financial 
sector or the loss of east- and west-coast undersea fibre cables.
Other initiatives such as the SARB’s Payments Ecosystem Modernisation (PEM) 
Programme also support financial stability by ensuring the ongoing flow of funds, 
even during periods of stress.

The role of crisis simulation exercises in increasing 
financial system resilience
Overview
The SARB conducts crisis simulation exercises in the normal course of business. The 
previous simulation was conducted during 2023. The SARB conducted two additional 
simulation exercises in 2025. The first simulation was aimed at testing the processes 
of the SARB (i.e. the Resolution Authority) and CODI, and the second simulation was 
an industry-wide OCARM which could be invoked in the event of a severe disruption 
to the economy.
Simulation to test Resolution Authority and CODI processes
This scenario simulated the failure of a fictitious, medium-sized bank. The Resolution 
Authority and CODI established a control team with support from specialists of the 
World Bank Group. Participants in the simulation were from the PA, the SARB’s Legal 
Services, Financial Markets, Communications and Financial Services departments and 
the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). The role of the Minister of Finance, 
who needs to issue a determination to place a designated institution in resolution, 
was played by the control team.
The exercise was planned in such a way that placing the bank in resolution was 
inevitable. Much of the discussion and focus of the exercise centred on when the 
trigger point had been reached to place the bank in resolution. Several disruptive but 
plausible hypothetical developments were included during the course of the exercise 
to complicate the decision-making process. These included an emergency liquidity 
assistance application from the bank which needed to be considered, spillovers to 
another (solvent) bank in the same group as the failing bank, as well as pressure 
from ‘fake news’ shared via social media. Participants could consult and collaborate 
freely with the various participant groupings, but needed to follow their own internal 
processes to arrive at the most appropriate decision, like they would in a real-life 
scenario. 
The key decisions that had to be taken during the exercise were around whether the 
bank was failing or likely to fail, when to communicate to the public, distinguishing 
between temporary liquidity issues and more structural solvency issues, when and 
with whom to coordinate, the emergency liquidity assistance application, the selection 
and deployment of resolution tools, the valuation and funding of the resolution action, 
and the effect on financial inclusion and competition. 
The World Bank commended the SARB’s constant communication with the public, 
reassuring them that their money was safe. Competition issues were discussed by 
the participants and the SARB’s legal powers in resolution were confirmed. Overall, 
the simulation exercise was well executed and provided valuable insights into existing 
key strengths as well as areas for improvement.
Simulation to test the OCARM initiative
On 1 April 2025, a scenario-based desktop exercise was conducted with the SARB and 
industry participants who were selected as a representative sample of the payments, 
cash, markets, savings and investments industries. The scenario was a national grid 
failure with a time frame within which to execute OCARM.
Overall, the simulation exercise provided valuable insights into existing strengths as 
well as scope for improvement. The simulation highlighted the importance of both 
the SARB and industry’s ability to meet the principles contained in the OCARM 
framework. Participants agreed on the importance of continuously improving the

OCARM playbooks and communicating this appropriately across the sector. The 
simulation was successful in identifying challenges that could prevent an orderly 
OCARM, which means this can be proactively addressed at an industry level.
2024 Climate Risk Stress Test of South 
African systemically important banks 
Executive summary
Climate change presents risks to the stability of the South African financial system. 
The domestic financial system’s vulnerability to climate-related risks is influenced 
by its exposure to carbon-intensive activities, businesses and physical assets. South 
Africa has already experienced the realisation of some of these risks, and their 
incidence is likely to increase in the future. 
In support of its legal mandate to protect and enhance financial stability, the SARB 
conducted a CRST for the first time, in 2024. The SARB’s CRST was an exploratory 
macroprudential stress test that subjected systemically important South African 
banks to a set of plausible, long-term climate-related scenarios. 
The exercise indicated that while systemically important financial institution (SIFI) 
banks are reasonably well positioned to assess their vulnerability to climate risks, 
certain challenges remain, specifically around data gaps and modelling capabilities. 
Meanwhile, the quantitative results highlighted areas for further research.
Purpose, scope and methodology
The CRST covered the six South African banks designated as SIFIs26 under section 29 
of the FSR Act. The primary goal of the CRST was to test the resilience of the banking 
sector to physical27 and transition 28 risks by evaluating SIFIs’ exposures. As the first 
exercise of its kind in South Africa, the CRST included the secondary objective of 
assessing banks’ data and methodological processes for considering climate-related 
risks. 
Given data gaps and modelling constraints, full balance-sheet modelling was not 
included in the exercise. Instead, SIFIs were required to estimate the impact of various 
climate scenarios on credit risk quantitatively, while other key risks were assessed 
qualitatively. 
26  Absa, Capitec, FirstRand, Investec, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. As at the reference date of the 
exercise (31 December 2023) these institutions accounted for 92% of the total banking sector assets.
27  Physical risks include chronic changes such as rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns, alongside 
acute events such as floods and droughts. 
28  Transition risk encompasses challenges arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy, driven by 
regulatory changes, market shifts, and technological advancements. It also includes behavioural 
changes, such as shifts in consumer preferences and investor demands towards sustainability.

Figure 16 summarises the key elements of the CRST framework and design features. 
The framework consists of a set of common scenarios and key modelling assumptions 
to ensure consistent and comparable outcomes across participant banks. Given the 
long-term nature of climate risks, the projection horizon was set out to the year 2050.
The 2024 CRST framework used both a bottom-up (BU) and a top-down (TD) 
approach for projections. BU assessments were conducted by individual SIFI banks 
using internally developed stress-testing models and expert judgment based on the 
SARB’s climate scenarios discussed later. To validate the BU submissions, the CRST 
included a TD assessment using an internally developed model. Box 2 details the 
SARB’s TD CRST modelling framework.

SIFIs were asked to break down their exposures across three dimensions for the CRST. 
First, the participating banks were required to perform the natural split between their 
retail and corporate banking books, while additionally isolating the largest ‘single 
name’ counterparties (subject to the counterparties ’ exposures being more than or 
equal to 5% of the individual SIFI’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital). Second, for 
each counterparty on their balance sheet, the banks were required to identify an 
economic sector classification. For the corporate counterparties, sectoral allocation 
was assigned to the entities’ main source of activity, while for retail counterparties, 
sectoral exposures were allocated to their source of employment or income. Finally, 
participating banks were tasked with identifying a geographical location (at provincial 
level) for each exposure.
The inclusion of the retail counterparties or private households in the CRST is relatively 
unique in comparison to climate scenario analysis performed in other jurisdictions.

3  The Frye-Jacobs relationship enables the prediction of the conditional LGD as a function of the 
conditional PD.
The SARB’s top-down (TD) climate credit-risk model was designed both to assess climate-
change effects on banks’ credit risk, and to challenge and validate participating banks’ own 
results. The model is based on the same set of Climate Risk Stress Test (CRST) assumptions 
and scenarios given to the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). 
The model is an adaptation of the methodologies applied by the United Nations Environment 
Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI)1 and the Bank of Canada (BoC)2. The key output of 
the climate model was expected credit losses, which is the product of credit exposure and 
climate-adjusted probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD).
Climate-adjusted PDs were derived by converting through-the-cycle PDs into a multi-
factor Vasicek model, incorporating multiple factors to capture transition and physical 
risks on both macroeconomic and sectoral scales. These factors introduced systematic 
risk to asset values, shifting their distribution. As shown in Figure B2.1 below, a reduction 
in obligor asset values would shift the credit loss distribution to the right, indicating 
increased credit risks. LGDs were modelled using the Frye-Jacobs relationship 3 to ensure 
they are sensitive to the same factors driving the PDs.

As climate risk does not discriminate between corporate entities and the public in 
general, the exclusion of private households from a climate scenario assessment will 
tend to understate the full impact. Recent global events have attested to the fact that 
physical risks impact households as much as corporate entities. 
Given heterogeneity within sectors, and drawing from existing academic literature, 29  
economic sector classifications were further divided 30 into climate-sensitive and 
non-climate-sensitive categories. For example, within the agriculture sector, certain 
subsectors with drought-resistant crops might be considered less climate sensitive. 
By categorising SIFI exposures via this combined classification system (i.e. the CRST 
taxonomy), the results can be assessed through a climate-sensitive lens.
Given the exploratory nature of the CRST exercise, relatively few prescriptive 
assumptions were provided. SIFIs were not required to anticipate changes to 
accounting standards, tax regimes, or regulatory reforms effective after the reference 
date (31 December 2023). Furthermore, both the BU and TD exercises followed a 
static balance sheet approach throughout the projection period, implying that the 
size and asset mix of the balance sheet remain unchanged over the forecast horizon. 
This approach enhanced the ability to measure potential risks by isolating scenario 
impacts on bank exposures, but did not consider management actions that could 
mitigate risks. 
Scenarios
The CRST was based on three long-term scenarios developed by the Network for 
Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in 2023. 31 These scenarios were adapted for 
South Africa through joint modelling work by the International Food Policy Research 
Institute (IFPRI) 32 and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research 
(NIESR).33  The scenarios explored a range of physical and transition risks as shown 
in Figure 17. It should be noted that the positioning of scenarios is approximate and 
based on an assessment of physical and transition risks to the year 2100.

The ‘hot house world’ and ‘too little, too late’ scenarios mainly explore the physical 
risks associated with delayed policy action, while the ‘orderly’ and ‘disorderly’ 
scenarios mainly explore transition risk. Three scenarios were selected for the CRST, 
namely ‘Current policies’, ‘Delayed transition’ and ‘Net zero 2050’. These scenarios 
are not forecasts, but rather represent a range of plausible climate futures. They 
are differentiated primarily by their level of climate ambition, the timing of policy 
implementation, the distribution of policy measures across sectors and regions, 
and technology assumptions such as the availability and viability of carbon dioxide 
removal. 
The ‘Current policies’ scenario assumes no new measures to improve on current 
policies. Technology change is slow, and there is low use of carbon dioxide removal 
technologies. As a result, the transition to a carbon-neutral economy never occurs. 
The failure to halt significant global warming leads to severe physical risks as critical 
temperature thresholds are exceeded.
In the ‘Delayed transition’ scenario, by contrast, annual emissions decrease  after 
2030, with strong policies implemented to compensate for lost time and limit global 
warming to below 2°C. Implementation is disorderly with high variation across 
countries and sectors. 
The ‘Net zero 2050’ scenario assumes immediate policy action that becomes 
gradually more stringent. Technological change is rapid with medium to high use of 
innovative carbon dioxide removal technologies. This limits global warming to 1.5°C, 
with the world reaching global net zero CO 2 emissions around 2050. This results 
in more subdued physical risks that are further mitigated by the benefits of more 
orderly and timely transition efforts. 
Figure 18 shows how GDP is likely to be impacted compared with a hypothetical 
scenario in which no transition or physical risks occur. The results show that climate 
change is likely to have a negative impact on GDP across all scenarios, with the 
physical risks emanating from climate change likely to outweigh transition risks. 
However, transition risks, which are largely driven by higher carbon prices and the

implementation of related policies, can be minimised through an orderly and early 
transition.34 This is seen in the ‘Net zero 2050’ scenario, where the physical risks from 
climate change are partially offset by growth effects from carbon revenue recycling.35

The interconnected nature of climate shocks mean that other macroeconomic 
channels are also affected. Inflation rates are expected to increase significantly in 
the near term for the ‘Net zero 2050’ scenario due to the immediate implementation 
of mitigation strategies. However, for the ‘Delayed transition’ scenario, inflation is 
expected to follow current policies and then breach the upper inflationary band from 
2030 as the shadow carbon prices add upward inflationary pressure to the consumer 
goods basket. All three scenarios trigger a monetary policy response to mitigate the 
ensuing price instability.
Quantitative results 
Using the CRST climate-sensitivity taxonomy, participant banks categorised 68% 
of their total credit exposure as non-climate sensitive and 32% as climate sensitive 
at the end of 2023. The latter percentage represents SIFIs’ counterparty exposure 
to sectors that are either carbon intensive or undergoing transitions to low carbon 
intensity. Figure 1 9 shows a breakdown of the climate-sensitive segment across 
economic sectors.

Figure 20 illustrates the expected credit losses over the projection horizon, across 
the three scenarios, from both a BU and TD perspective. Aligned with the increased 
price effects and weaker economic growth in the ‘Delayed transition’ scenario, both 
the BU and TD results indicate that losses will be most severe in the medium to 
long term. 
Contrary to expectations, the ‘Current policies’ scenario appears to have the least 
severe impact within the projection horizon. Imperative to this finding is the limitation 
of the cut-off date of the CRST projection horizon of 2050. If the horizon was 
extended further, eventually physical damages nature -related risks from unabated 
climate change in the ‘Current policies’ scenario would accelerate rapidly whilst the 
mitigating climate policies from the ‘Net zero 2050’ and ‘Delayed transition’ scenarios 
would positively impact the economy, lead to lower average temperatures and in turn 
reduce losses.

To mitigate against these losses, banks raise impairments against both climate-
sensitive and non-climate-sensitive categories. Figure 21 shows that, in the short 
run, the average pool of new impairments for the non-climate-sensitive categories 
outweighs the climate -sensitive segments relative to their performing exposures. 
However, over the medium to longer term, the gap between climate-sensitive and

To better understand the sectoral exposures within the retail credit book of the SIFI 
banks, Figure 22 depicts one of the most significant asset classes for banks, namely 
residential mortgages. This asset class provides unique insights as it is susceptible to both 
physical risk (i.e. due to lower house prices and/or risk to damage from acute risk) and 
transition risk (i.e. if borrowers’ ability to repay their home loans is negatively impacted).

Frequent physical risk events can also reduce the market value of collateral over 
time, posing the risk of stranded assets. The severe floods in KwaZulu-Natal in 
2022 illustrated the detrimental impact on both the economy and collateral values, 
especially if such events become more frequent.
The CRST exercise also assessed the impact of physical risk on sectors like real estate, 
which approximates to corporate mortgage advances. LGD ratios were evaluated 
with and without insurance coverage. This metric was primarily designed to test the 
hypothesis that if insurers withdrew coverage, banks could face significant losses 
from climate-related events. Without insurance, the financial burden of damages 
from extreme weather events would fall directly on the banks, leading to increased 
loan defaults and lower collateral values. Any absence of insurance for natural 
catastrophe events would lead to higher LGDs, underscoring the critical role of 
insurance in managing and transferring risk. To mitigate these risks, banks may need 
to adopt more stringent measures or explore innovative financial instruments and 
partnerships. This warrants further research and cross-collaboration between the 
insurance and banking sectors.
Qualitative results
In addition to credit risk, the CRST also included qualitative assessments of climate risk 
across various Pillar 1 risks. SIFIs’ responses to the qualitative evaluation assessments 
highlight several key areas for future focus. Firstly, SIFIs are committed to aligning 
with the PA’s 2024 Guidance Note s on climate-related disclosures for banks, 36  
demonstrating a continuous effort to enhance climate risk management practices. 
However, the assessments revealed significant limitations in data and modelling 
capabilities, which hinder comprehensive climate risk assessments. To bridge this 
gap and to allow prioritisation for the development of future modelling capabilities, 
SIFIs ranked the risk categories (Table 1) within the market and operational risk pillars 
that would be most impacted by climate risk.

The participating banks’ collated responses to the qualitative component of the 
CRST underscore that climate risk affects various aspects of the banking sector. 
Regular staff training and application of innovative modelling approaches has 
been emphasised as a crucial component in equipping SIFIs to manage climate risk 
effectively. Additionally, business continuity plans have been updated to account for 
natural catastrophes that may occur due to climate change, ensuring and enhancing 
operational resilience.
Conclusion 
The primary purpose of the CRST was to test the resilience of the banking sector to 
climate change, from both a physical and transition risk perspective. As the world is 
confronted with increasing and uncertain climate risks, exercises of this nature for 
financial stability monitoring purposes are critical. The CRST exercise was able to 
deliver the following objectives and outcomes:
•  Gain an understanding of SIFIs’ current climate risk stress-testing frameworks and 
asses their level of preparedness.
• Identify data gaps and collective challenges faced by SIFIs.
•  Develop climate scenario analysis capabilities both in financial institutions and 
the SARB. 
•  Understand the mitigating actions that SIFIs might take in response to climate-
related risks.
The results indicate that while some SIFIs demonstrated the ability to assess climate 
risk and implement potential mitigation strategies effectively, this exercise—being 
the first of its kind—also highlighted areas for improvement. The SARB will continue 
to engage with SIFIs to resolve data challenges that need to be addressed to better 
assess and embed climate risk within their existing risk management frameworks and 
stress-testing capabilities.

of financial sector laws, without interruption despite changes in economic 
circumstances, and without a loss of general confidence in the ability of financial 
institutions and financial market infrastructures to do so. 
•  Vulnerability: A characteristic of the financial system that increases the likelihood 
and/or impact of a financial stability risk realising. 
• Shock: An event that may trigger the realisation of financial stability risk. 
• Amplifier: A property, factor or action that increases the vulnerability. 
• Mitigant: A property, factor or action that reduces the vulnerability. 
•  Transmission channels or mechanisms:  The channels through which the 
materialisation of a financial stability risk could cause financial instability. 
• Residual vulnerability:  The assessed vulnerability after considering mitigants. 
•  Resilience: A characteristic of the financial system that decreases the likelihood 
and/or impact of a financial stability risk realising. 
•  Financial market infrastructures (FMIs): FMIs include payment market 
infrastructures and market infrastructures (i.e. exchanges, central securities 
depositories, central counterparties, clearing houses and trade repositories).
